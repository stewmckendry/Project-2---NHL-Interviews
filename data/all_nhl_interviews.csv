https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/19/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-31-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Sheldon Keefe on whether he is concerned about his team’s North Division lead shrinking:,The standings are what they are. I think they’re a symptom of the fact that we haven’t gotten results here as of late. You don’t need any more of a wake-up call than that.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/19/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-31-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on why now was the right time to get Alex Galchenyuk into the lineup:,"We just felt that having four days off here between games and a couple of practice days was a good chance for him to be around our team a little bit more. He’s played very well with theMarlies. Perhaps more importantly, he has handled himself really well. He’s got lots of confidence and is really feeling good about his game, so the timing is right for all those reasons. I think he’s had a couple of really good days here with us. I know he’s excited to play today. We do have a role to play in [ensuring it goes well]. I think we recognized that there’s more to this player here in terms of what he has to offer but also what he needed — that’s why we took the patient approach with him. We gave him the opportunity to go down with theMarlies, really find his game, and not just rush him in. The first thing is getting him a chance to play with good players.. those guys looked really good in practice yesterday."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/19/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-31-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on experimenting with the lines:,"I’m not sure there’s ever a situation where it’s ideal to experiment and move things around. Obviously, our place in the standings has changed dramatically here in the last few weeks, but I still believe that you’ve got to find ways to give people opportunities. You’ve got to try different things to find the right mix. The challenge, of course, is to do so while not hurting your chance to win that particular game. We need to get a win here tonight and we want to play well so, while I’m willing to try things, I’ve got to make sure that we’re optimizing the group and our chances of winning. At the same time — I’ve said it a lot in my time as a coach — I believe strongly that you have to try different things because the season is unpredictable, injuries are unpredictable, certain opponents are unpredictable, and you need to be able to adapt. The more you’ve been able to be flexible and try to create comfort in different players playing together, that can help to the confidence of the group when you do have to adapt to an injury."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/19/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-31-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on what he’s looking for from the third forward on the top two lines:,"You’re looking for different things there. At times, you are looking for that third player to be a little bit different than the other two in terms of what they provide because there are different jobs that need to be done on the ice. Sometimes you need a forechecker — someone that’s going to create a loose puck and be around the net to create space for others to move around the offensive zone. [Other times] you need someone who tracks really well and is going to be a reliable defender. There’s lots of different things that go into it. Sometimes it’s just a matter of you having players, such as Galchenyuk in this case, that you’re just trying to provide a great opportunity for. It allows you to move things around and try different things without creating too much change and discomfort."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/11/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-28-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Sheldon Keefe on the lack of changes on defense as of late and keeping Mikko Lehtonen scratched:,"We’ve reached a different phase of the season here. We gave lots of opportunities to different people early in the season, Mikko being one. At times [we changed things] when we didn’t really have a reason to change the lineup to give more opportunity for [Lehtonen] and others. Obviously, we’re at a point here now where the season has lots of momentum and we’re [at] the halfway point. You’ve got to give yourself the best opportunity to win everyday. That’s all part of it here now — everybody’s just going to have to wait for their next opportunity and continue to put in the proper work to do so. In Mikko’s case specifically, we have no doubts or questions about the work that he puts in. He’s extremely committed, extremely focused, and works very hard, so we’re happy with those kinds of things. For the last little while, we just haven’t seen a reason to make the change on defense."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/11/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-28-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on the Jets’ tendency to use three forwards in 3-on-3 OT:,"With the types of forwards that they have, when you get three of them on at the same time, there’s lots of skill. They’re obviously very dynamic but, at the same time, when you’re fortunate enough to get the puck, it presents some opportunities the other way potentially. I haven’t given it a great deal of thought. I think the first 60 minutes is occupying enough of our time."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/11/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-28-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on getting Kenny Agostino into the mix:,"He’s a guy that’s worked really hard and really waited for an opportunity to play. He’s never complained. He’s continued to work and has been a real leader and one of, if not the best, players down with theMarlies. Just another guy that hasn’t been given the same opportunities that a number of others have, and yet he’s still there and does his thing. In the games he’s played with theMarlies, he’s continued being the player that he’s established himself as in the American League. He also has NHL experience and, when we signed him into the organization a couple of offseasons ago, he was a guy coming off a full season in the NHL and hasn’t really had his chance here yet. We just think, with the way things have gone here for us in the last little bit, both because I haven’t liked what we’ve gotten out of our fourth line in the last little while and also having a fresh body in at forward and someone who’s fresh and ready for his chance, we think it might inject something into the group today."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/11/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-28-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on his relationship with Joe Thornton:,"He made it very clear that he wants to be coached when we chatted [before signing] him. That remains true. If you’ve got something that you think can help his game or help our team, he’s open to talk about it takes it very well. He’s open to suggestions — not just from me, but from the rest of our coaching staff and even our player development staff. The way that he conducts himself — he’s all about getting better and given himself the best opportunity to succeed despite what he’s been through in his career. He obviously has a lot of feedback that he provides as well and is valuable. He’s a guy that just loves to be on the ice because he loves the game. He feels it’s really important for himself to just have continuous reps — Jason Spezza is the same in that sense. At their age, they just feel that they want to continue to be on the ice and to stay sharp."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/04/07/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-game-40-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Update (5:10 p.m. EST): William Nylander is out tonight for precautionary reasons related to possible Covid exposure. The game will go ahead as planned.,"For precautionary reasons, William Nylander will not play tonight vs Montreal as he has had exposure to a possible positive case with a close contact outside the team.Nylander is isolating and the situation will be re-evaluated tomorrow pending the results of further testing. — Leafs PR (@LeafsPR)April 7, 2021"
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/04/07/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-game-40-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,,"Early word is the incubation period from when William Nylander had a possible COVID-19 exposure to when he skated with#leafsteammates this morning isn't believed to have been long enough for him to be considered contagious. Tonight's TOR/MTL game can go ahead as a result. — Chris Johnston (@reporterchris)April 7, 2021"
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/04/07/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-game-40-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Justin Holl on the Tavares line:,"They’ve been buzzing and getting a lot of chances. [Galchenyuk’s] been doing a great job being aggressive and getting on the forecheck and working hard all over the ice . They’re starting to get rewarded for it, which is really great to see."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/04/07/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-game-40-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Holl on whether the condensed schedule is making conditioning difficult:,"I was talking about it with [Tavares] this morning, actually. I said, “I can’t remember… Are the games always this condensed?'” He said, “In the second half of the year, it’s kind of similar to this.” It’s not too different, but I think with coming back from the west coast and only getting a day — things of that nature are the challenges that we’re dealing with. That being said, I think we’ve been handling it well and guys have been smart about their recovery."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/04/07/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-game-40-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Sheldon Keefe on what is allowing his team to win so many games of late:,"Special teams are a big factor. When we went on that stretch where we weren’t winning, [it seemed] like all the games were all one-goal games. Our powerp lay wasn’t getting it done for us and the penalty kill seemed to be letting one in consistently. We’ve stabilized the PK, and it’s become one of our strengths here again. The power play, obviously, had been reeling, but in a huge moment, it scored us a massive goal to get us a lead the other night. Those things make a big difference, but the things I focus on are the consistency of the mindset of our team and just remaining calm and confident and evenkeeled. Throughout each of those stretches that you mentioned, the guys have come in and continued to work. When we were losing, guys didn’t get down on each other. They just continued to come to the rink, work hard, be positive, and put in the necessary work to make sure that it does [turn around]. I think that’s what I take out of this season — the spirit of the team has been consistent."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/04/07/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-game-40-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on whether Campbell’s attitude has changed since he’s become more successful this season:,"It [was] the same as it is now. He’s a guy that comes in and has lots of energy about him. He’s got a bounce in his step all the time. He works every single day to the maximum that he can on the ice and off the ice. He’s a guy that the players love to be around. No matter the circumstance — whether he’s playing, or he’s not playing, or if he’s injured, or if he’s healthy — when you encounter him around the room, he makes it better with the energy that he has. He’s done that since he arrived in the trade from L.A."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/14/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-ottawa-senators-game-30-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Sheldon Keefe on the team’s energy levels and the need to respond tonight:,"You’re feeling the schedule. It’s having an effect, but I think it’s all relative. There is no reason for us to not be all in on this game here with the response needed from last night’s game. We do have a bit of time to decompress after."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/14/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-ottawa-senators-game-30-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Senators head coach D.J Smith on what they’ve done well against the Leafs this season:,"When we’ve beaten them, we’ve had really good goaltending. Our guys get feeling loose and we’ve scored some goals and made some plays. We’ve been up for the games [against] them for sure. I think they’ve been good battles. There are some teams we’ve matched up well [against] and others we haven’t, but we’ve found a way to be really competitive in the games against [Toronto]."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/14/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-ottawa-senators-game-30-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,"D.J Smith on fourth-line center Clark Bishop, who made his Senators debut on Friday:",I thought he was very responsible and he wins faceoffs. I think he’s got a little bit of pace to his game with some size. We’d like to look at him again.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/14/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-ottawa-senators-game-30-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,D.J Smith on Nick Paul’s versatility and growth:,"I think Nick can do a bit of everything. You know, he played centre in Junior — he’s really improved on faceoffs, especially [on] his backhand. I trust Nick in all situations. He’s one of those guys — if you needed him to play a bottom-six role at center, he could. I think he also complements centers because he can play in his own zone. He’s kind of a guy that all coaches want to have on their team. He can play in all situations."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/14/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-ottawa-senators-game-30-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,D.J Smith on dealing with losing when coaching a rebuilding team:,"Players want to win every single day and everyone wants to win. We know where we’re at as a team and as an organization compared to where Toronto is or Edmonton is. They’re competing and trying to win the Stanley Cup today. Not to say that [young teams] don’t have a chance to ever win, but you have to go through the trials and tribulations of young guys turning it over and making mistakes and causing goals. I think it’s Auston Matthews’ fifth year this year — now it looks like [Toronto’s] ready to go."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/04/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-37-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Paul Maurice on Blake Wheeler’s status:,"He was good at the morning skate and said he felt good. We’ll leave it to tonight to make sure that he returns feeling the same way. If he returns feeling the same way, then he’ll be a player for us."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/04/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-37-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Maurice on if Toronto’s PK is different to match up against than other teams:,"They do have a number of players that kill [and] have excellent speed. If you’ve got a guy that really skates, they’re hard to catch. You’re still planning for success on your power play — you’re running what you want to run. Our power play’s been really good — it’s set fairly low on the one unit, so the risk of a turnover is [higher]. More times than not, you’ll see it turn into a 2-on-1 where the top guy gets his stick on it and the weak side guy jumps, and we’re pressed really low. You see it more on [the first unit]. The other unit, because [Ehlers] runs a bit higher in what they’re doing, it doesn’t happen as often with those guys. There’s no a significant style difference in the way Toronto kills as opposed to any other team. They do have speed."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/04/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-37-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Alex Galchenyuk on the motivation he gathers from the amount he’s bounced around the league:,"It’s not like it’s the foundation — that I’ve been with a few teams, so that’s why I’m motivated. I train well all summer and I’m prepared for a big year. Sometimes things don’t work out, but you stick with it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/04/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-37-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Galchenyuk on what makes theLeafsa winning team:,"I think just the balance of everything — our offense, solid defense, and we’ve been getting good goaltending as of late. Great group of guys — a mix of veterans and young guys. You can see what makes this team successful. You’ve got to stick with it and keep going."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/04/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-37-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Sheldon Keefe on starting the Tavares line at the beginning of each period:,"Not a whole lot went into it. You make a decision every night on who you’re going to start. That line’s been playing well, so that was part of it. Galchenyuk, since he’s been a part of that line — really, since he’s come into our lineup — has been very consistent in his work habits and his details in his game. He’s very competitive and when the puck comes to him, he makes a play with it. He’s really helped the line for sure, but I think both John and Willy have been playing well [too]."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/04/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-37-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on a best-on-best matchup approach against Winnipeg:,"The main dynamic is that you’re playing against high-scorers. That line is definitely trying to score. They’re trying to look for their own chances in transition. You’ve got some opportunities offensively that might present themselves. At the same time, you have to be that much more alert defensively. If the puck goes the other way, they’re so dangerous and they transition quick. That can pull away from some of your offense because you have to be mindful of it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/04/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-37-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on the Copp-Lowry-Appleton line:,The Lowry line does it a little bit differently. They transition very well. They’ve got good speed on the wings. They challenge the net. They spend time in the offensive zone. It’s a challenge all around with how the depth goes all the way through their lineup.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/04/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-37-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on whether Travis Dermott has met expectations this season:,"Yeah, I think so. I know that there’s focus at times when he doesn’t play a lot, but I don’t look at that as a great representation of how we feel about his season. We’ve looked at it, and in a lot of ways, he’s been the sixth defenseman. Sometimes, with the way the game goes — whether it’s special teams, matchups, the score — you tend to shorten the bench, and it’s usually the sixth defenseman that gets caught up in that a little bit. When we look at his game, there are definitely been really strong nights where it’s all come together. There are others where he’s been strong on the defensive side, but his work with the puck hasn’t been there. We look at the large sample, and he’s done what we’ve asked of him."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/02/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-22-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Sheldon Keefe on sending Alex Galchenyuk to theMarlies:,It’s an environment where he can really look to get comfortable and find his game in our surroundings and in our system and things like that. [We want him] to find his confidence and not be so concerned about his place in the lineup or making mistakes and things like that.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/02/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-22-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on the new top line of Thornton-Tavares-Marner:,"Three really good players. It’s not new for us here. We’ve already played a game this season without Auston against the Oilers. So, putting John and Mitch together, they’ve got a lot of history and played together well this season and they’ve done it in previous seasons. Having Joe available today will give our whole group a boost."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/02/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-22-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on Alexander Barabanov’s increased role:,"The biggest thing is he just looks more confident with the puck, he’s getting out of our zone and through the neutral zone a lot better. Some of that is circumstantial; he’s been in offensive positions and been able to use his strengths. The continued development we want to see from him is in those areas where the puck comes up the wall and he has to make a play in the defensive zone. When we look at scoring chance generation, he’s been among the leaders for us in the last couple of games here, so you want to see if he can look to build upon that. Obviously, like all of our players, it needs to be done with a real good defensive foundation, but we want to keep him rolling here and see if we can get some traction."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/02/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-22-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on last time the Leafs played the Oilers without Matthews:,"Yeah, we just played hard and we were resilient. Our power play was good for us. Everyone just steps up and plays a little bit more and plays a little bit better. Whether we had Auston or not, we know that’s [going to be important] with an Edmonton team that’s playing really well and is very confident."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/02/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-22-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on the Mikheyev-Engvall-Hyman line:,"[They have] a lot of speed, a lot of tenacity on the puck. We like [them] on the road especially — matchups are difficult and having a line that you can feel good about when you put them over the boards [is important]. It was very effective for us in Montreal and we look to see that continue. The other lines have to be going well in order for us to maintain it because of the injures that we’re working through. I think [Engvall] is finding a bit more comfort in his game here. Obviously, he played a lot more consistently here of late. I think Mikheyev, at the same time, has really been coming on here both with the puck and without the puck. He’s disrupting plays, making plays, getting down low in the offensive zone — he’s been very good. We’ve already talked about Hyman and what he brings whatever line he’s on. I think it’s just the three of them really working together on that, but Pierre’s game is certainly starting to round out for us."

We’re looking for a key play right now, and we got to get more on the inside. Obviously, we’re missing some key pieces up front, but that’s no excuse. We have the guys to [score], and we know that.” – Joseph Blandisi on theMarlies‘ lack of scoring recently"
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/06/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vancouver-canucks-game-26-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Among the highlights:,"“Our best young players are 21, 22, 23, years old. Teams in this division, they’re physically mature, their star players are older players.” “We had the week training camp, no exhibition games, and then we started the games. I think part of our problems early on were we played 16 games in 25 nights, and in those 25 nights, we had two practices in 19 days.” “Realistically, if you’re asking me when will the day be that we can compete with the best teams in the league, I think that [Sedin contract] timeline is fair. This is year two, and by our fourth or fifth year, I hope we’ll be there with the elite teams in the league.”"
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-26-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Sheldon Keefe on the challenge in front of the team tonight:,"As I alluded to yesterday, they had injury issues last time we [played them]. They’re a very deep team. Every shift, they’re coming and have different elements on every line, every d-pair, and, obviously, in goal. [They] have lots of confidence right now as a team. They’ve played extremely well. They present great challenges and you’ve got to be prepared for that, but most of all, we have to make sure that — coming off the west-coast road trip — we come back here and get back to our game."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-26-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on Pierre-Luc Dubois:,"Big strong guy, skates really well through the neutral zone, and he has a good shot. No matter how they use him or who he’s playing with, he’s a lot to handle. He, of course, is one of many dangerous people that they have and we have to do a good job against."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-26-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on the number of minor tweaks to the team’s power-play personnel:,"Really just trying to find something we like. We’ve dealt with injuries, whether it’s Thornton our or Simmonds out — two important pieces of [the power play]. Then you’ve got Auston’s situation here in the last little while, so we’re just trying to find that right mix, but I think it’s really nothing more than dealing with and compensating for injuries."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-26-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Pierre-Luc Dubois on his linemates Nikolaj Ehlers and Kyle Connor:,"I love playing with those two guys. [Ehlers] I knew from junior what he could do [Connor] we played against only twice a year, but the speed, hands, passing, and the shooting — he can do everything. I know this year, he’s been shooting the puck more and he’s got a good shot, so why not? I think [Connor] is one of the most underrated players in the NHL — he’s dangerous, he can pass the puck also, but he’s got such a quick release that it’s fun to play with [him]. I think, as a centerman, I have to support those two guys. In the defensive zone, I’ve got to work for them and win the puck so we can get up ice. I’ve loved playing with them."

https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/29/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-35-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Sheldon Keefe on the reasons for giving Michael Hutchinson the start tonight:,"We’ve got to be really smart with how we manage Jack’s workload here. The reality is that he hasn’t been playing at 100% and the games take a toll on him. The combination of the fact that he’s not used to playing multiple games in a row and the fact that his body hasn’t quite cooperated with him the way he’d like to this season, we’ve got to be really smart. He took the day [off] yesterday because he wasn’t feeling the best coming off the game. I think he’s feeling better today and that’s positive — I just think us continuing to roll him out there when he’s not 100% is not smart so we’ve got to manage it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/29/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-35-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on coaching against McDavid and Draisaitl on the same line:,"It changes a little bit just in terms of the matchup — you’re a little more concerned about the [it]. Obviously, it’s harder to match against them when they’re on separate lines. That said, when they are together, you can control the matchup a little bit more when you make a mistake. We looked at it different ways — between the Matthews [line] and Engvall [line], we tried to get that matchup going, but the difficulty is they play so much and it has the ability to really disrupt your own flow. You kind of worry about that matchup and lose to flow with your own bench. I’ve got to manage that here tonight, but there’s certainly more hype, awareness, and narrow focus when they’re together. Like I said, when you’ve got him together you’re worried about that one mistake — it’s much more dangerous. It’s also not overly comforting when one of them leaves the ice and the other comes out."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/29/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-35-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on moving Hyman back to Matthews’ line to go up against McDavid’s line:,"Yeah, that was part of it. I thought I was going to get away from [the Engvall line] matchup more and just generally knew that I was going to play the Matthews line that much more and wanted Hyman to be a part of that."

It wasn’t just the third period. They capitalized on the one in the third period. They got a break on the third goal to tie it up. I didn’t think we played as well as we needed to the whole game. Smith was excellent in goal. We’re going to need to be better tonight if we expect to win.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/29/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-35-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Tippett on how his team’s unplanned week off affected them:,"You hope you got some rest. [But] you can never, no matter how hard you practice, [get] to the competitive levels that match a game. Those are the things you hope are in place as soon as you get going. I thought we were a little bit slow to react and our puck play was a little slow, especially in the first period. You could tell we hadn’t played in a little bit. It’s just human nature. You can’t get yourself to the competitive level you want to. When you miss a week, you’ve got to work to get it back. As the game went on, we got a little better — the second period was better. There’s still another level we’ve got to get to."

https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/04/05/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-39-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Darryl Sutter on his team’s inconsistency as of late:,"When you say it’s by periods or by shifts, that’s not by games. The problem with our team is not [if] they can play at that pace now — the problem with some of our players is sustaining that pace. For example, last night [we did a good job] against the Matthews and Tavares lines if you look at it as a whole, but then you look at two or three shifts where guys couldn’t keep up with them. How much of that is related to conditioning, or other parts of their game? That’s not for me to publicly debate. There is a difference in [other] clubs and ours in terms of that. You have to be able to play. There are guys that play 10 minutes. There are guys that play 23 minutes. Off the top of my head, I’m going to bet [Mark Giordano] played the most minutes last night and probably played the most quality minutes. You have a lot of guys that are looked on as really good players that play in the teens or less, and if they can’t sustain a high pace of play and execution against top players, that means that they are getting outplayed badly one-on-one."

There’s not just one thing with [Valimaki] there. He’s got lots to work on to become a regular NHLer. He hasn’t had much experience, to be quite honest… The bottom line is, with a lot of these players, okay has kind of been the benchmark. You have to be a bit above ok."

He jumped up into the rush and won a battle to slide the puck in front for two good initial looks for Knies and Matthews before Knies found Matthews in front for the goal. Benoit didn’t grab an official assist, but the extra-effort play late in his shift set the whole offensive sequence in motion.","Matthews 22nd of the Season vs Penguins courtesy of@Bonsie1951and@Jim_Ralphpic.twitter.com/X9ArXSI8e3 — Maple Leafs Hotstove (@LeafsNews)March 2, 2025"

I thought he was a real factor. I got a sense of what he can bring there as a guy who gets really difficult matchups, starts in his own end, plays against good players. I thought he had a lot of shifts against our best players where you thought you would be getting the upper hand and it didn’t work out that way. He has a history of being a very reliable defensive player — a guy who knows exactly who he is and what he needs to do to help his team win. It is great for us to be able to add someone of his experience. He is a little bit different in how he plays lower in the lineup. The priority for us is to get him healthy and go from there. We are excited to add him to the group."

That is the biggest piece of it. Alex has played extremely well — skated well, is making plays, has lots of confidence. I feel good about how he has done with John and how that line with Will has worked out. I think he has brought a lot to that. The line is broken up with Will’s absence, so it is a good opportunity here now for me to give him a look on a different line and see how that goes. Hyman with Matthews and Marner was rolling pretty well. We have an abundance of confidence that line, at any time, can be rolling for us. It is important for us with the games remaining in the regular season to try some different things and be sure that we have the right mix by the time we get through it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/04/10/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-ottawa-senators-game-41-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,DJ Smith on Alex Galchenyuk not working out in Ottawa:,"He worked really hard. He worked on the details. He worked away from the puck. Ultimately, we have some guys in front of him. For us, you have Brady Tkachuk on the left side, Tim Stutzle, Nick Paul. You have a bunch of guys. You’ve got Formenton. With where we are at as a team and the process we are in, the kids not only have to play but deserve to play as well. They have played well. It is no slight to him. He is plenty good enough to play, but at what cost? I think Tim Stutzle has had a great year, Brady is a real good player, and Nick Paul as well. It was kind of jammed on the left side. I can tell you he worked hard off the ice. He was a good teammate. He really worked on his details. We are happy he has had an opportunity here and has run with it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/04/10/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-ottawa-senators-game-41-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Smith on Connor Brown’s six-game goal streak:,"He is getting to the net. It is such an easy thing to say, but I think when players go cold, they aren’t near the net. They don’t shoot enough. If you look, he is getting four or five shots a game now. Sometimes the puck just finds a way to go in. Sometimes, you want the perfect shot to go in for you. Just keep getting volume to the net and eventually they go in. Like anything else, his confidence is as high as it has ever been. When he wasn’t scoring, it wasn’t. It is a streaky league. You just have to keep working every day and doing the right things. Sometimes the bounces go your way."

There was the end of a road trip and [we wanted] a bit of a change to see if we could spark something. I wanted to be careful about changing [Dubois]’s line because, after game one of the Vancouver set, I really, really liked where they were at. In the two Edmonton games as well, I liked what they were doing, and then it just kind of levelled off. I thought for a while there that Schiefele’s line was grinding and playing hard, but there wasn’t a whole lot going on, so that was the other part. You’ve got to give your team the best chance to win every night but you also have to understand your team by the time the regular season’s over. We see such different styles of hockey in this division. [The] Vancouver and Calgary [games] had been very straight-line, almost every puck [was] dumped, with really physical battles at both ends. The Toronto and Edmonton series have so much danger off the rush, so you need to kind of get through these games with an idea of what changes could you make to your lines when you get into a series and something isn’t working. We need to learn more about this team — with Pierre-Luc, I’d like to leave it for a while and see where it goes."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/31/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-36-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Sheldon Keefe on whether he feels uncertain about his team’s goaltending at the moment:,"Yeah, a little bit. Certainly, when it comes to Jack’s situation, it’s kind of a day-to-day thing. He’s progressed well and it seems that when he has time to recover from his recent games, he does bounce back and feel good, so there’s less of a concern there. It is something we have to manage. You have to be responsible with it as a staff and be smart with it. He’s got to be honest and tell us exactly how he’s feeling."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/31/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-36-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on the Jets’ forwards:,"They have lots of depth and they use four lines very effectively. [They] have three lines that can score and a fourth line that has been contributing as well, does a good job defensively, and they trust them. From a forward perspective, they’re a very deep team that’s playing strong team defense with strong goaltending, so there’s a lot of things that present challenges from them as a team."

I didn’t have a lot of concerns about that going into the season — he’s played well. Like a lot of our guys, he’s had some nights that have not gone well for him, but I think for the most part, he’s bounced back from those and he’s showed great consistency for us in playing the role we need from him: being physical, defending efficiently, and helping us on the penalty kill."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-32-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Jason Spezza on Jack Campbell’s return:,"Yeah, Soup has obviously been great the games that he’s played. [He has a] trumendous attitude in practice every day and he just stays positive with going through a hard year in terms of injuries. When you’re dealing with injuries as a player, it can be frustrating, but he’s positive and has worked hard to get back. We’re happy to see him back to health and be a contributing member of our team. He knows that’s a key for him — to stay up beat. I’ve known [Campbell] for a bit now — he was in the Dallas organization — and he’s just always been a guy that works really hard and is very positive. I think it spreads through the locker room. You know that he’s had days where he’s been down and frustrated, but he tries to hide it and come in with a great attitude."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-32-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Spezza on the team’s losing streak:,"We’re getting team’s best every night. When we got off to start we did this season, it gets everyone’s attention. I think that shows that teams respect us and know that we’re a good team. I think you’re going to see teams’ best because of it. When you’re losing games, it seems like every mistake ends up in the back of you net. For us as players, we have to tighten that up, but we also have to know we’re doing lots of good things and it’s not fundamental changes we need to make. We just need to [tighten] up our habits a little bit and be a little more confident in our play. Every team goes through stretches like this. We’ve had chances to win games part of this losing streak. We just have to stick with it."

Simmonds didn’t get a great deal of minutes, but I thought he looked good for me. Obviously, I was watching that closely — he has good touches of the puck, skated well, got involved in the forecheck like he always does. That was very encouraging to see. He makes us more dangerous as a club."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-32-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on Campbell’s injury recovery:,"He’s just continued to be himself and put the work in. It’s a long road for him any time you have this nagging injury. He prepared to come back for that Edmonton game and had such  strong game yet aggravated [the injury] to the point that he needed more time off. That time sort of dragged on. He’s been feeling good for a period of time here now. He’s getting into a lot of our practice session, and he’s ready to go tonight. I know he’ll be excited to be back in net."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-32-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on playing from behind:,"Obviously, it’s been a major issue here for us in this little stretch — we’ve been playing from behind virtually every game. That’s tough. Obviously, we didn’t get the start we wanted yesterday. First shot on net goes in — mentally, that’s a tough hurdle for guys to get over. We’re going to have to be a lot better from the start here and look to play with the lead, but no matter what happens, we need  to remain resilient here and get on the right side of this game tonight."

Brad Treliving noted as much earlier in the week:,"“We have some cap space, but you look at the holes we have to fill, and it goes quickly.

We touched on it earlier — they’re good players, they’re going to get chances, and I expect them to come out hard tonight. We’re going to have to be ready. As far as the challenge tonight — [it’s the] same thing. We’ve got to stick with it.

They’ve helped eacho ther — [Rielly], the way he skates and is active in the rush, helps move the play up the ice. Brodie is there to be responsible and have a good stick and a good gap. For [Brodie], when it’s time to help the breakout, he makes a good play and that allows [Rielly] to atcivate as the offside defenseman. Both guys have paired well together and I’ve been happy with the way that has come together here — especially [because] it’s a new pairing, and there was no training camp or exhibition games."

I wouldn’t say there’s anything I wasn’t expecting. We had high expectations of our team and high expectations of the individuals. The guys have delivered on that. We’re happy with how things have gone here, but we also recognize, as much as things go quickly, there’s lots of hockey to be played and we’ve got to continue to grow as a group. We’re not where we think we can be as a team. We think we can continue to grow."

[It’s also] a mindset. A lot of odd-man rush situations are created on loose pucks in the offensive zone. [You] need to make a decision on those loose pucks — am I going to put myself on the offensive side of it so that, if the puck goes on the offensive side, I’m going to be in a really good place? Or do I put myself in a spot where, if it doesn’t go our way as a team then defensively, I’m going to be in a good place? I think we’ve made the wrong decision in those areas a lot of times in my time last season. That’s been a big focus for us. I think, for the most part, our players have been really good and diligent with that. That’s really the biggest difference for me."

They’ve only lost twice in overtime, compared to 10 and 11 in the previous two seasons. Some of it is luck-driven, but there were many times where they were just sloppy and made unnecessary risks at 3v3, and they are playing a lot more maturely in these situations now.","Congratulations to Borya Valis on signing a 3-Year Entry Level Contract with the Toronto#LeafsForever!#WeAreGoldStar!pic.twitter.com/QQBYXRiweA — Dan Milstein (@HockeyAgent1)March 1, 2025"

https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/13/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-29-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,"The fact that he’s remained an elite scoring threat, even when his opponents are now aware of his limitations, is indicative of how dominant Matthews’ boundless offensive repertoire has become. It is rare to ever see Matthews pass up an opportunity to shoot, especially when he has space in the middle of the ice as he did in the example below:","Muzzin gets a good look#Leafspic.twitter.com/n9X4l3MNtP — Maple Leafs Hotstove (@LeafsNews)March 12, 2021"
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/13/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-29-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,"Despite Matthews’ limitations, Sheldon Keefe doesn’t seem to think the team is risking anything by continuing to play him:","Medically, from what they’ve told me, it’s something that can get better even while he’s playing — that’s why he’s continuing to play. Obviously, when you get rest, it helps the cause but I think he and the medical team have been handling it very well."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/13/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-29-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Sheldon Keefe on Zach Hyman’s game lately:,"I don’t think there’s much to say about Hyman that hasn’t already been said. The work ethic that he has and the consistency that he brings with it, in addition to the confidence that he brings now with the puck and hang onto [it], just adds a whole other layer that makes him a very tough player to handle for the opposition."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/13/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-29-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on what went “wrong” with Mikko Lehtonen:,"Not having exhibition games really made it difficult for any incoming player to get the chance to sort of get the bugs out and adjust to the league, show what they can do, earn some additional trust — all those things. We think, all things considered, we adjusted to the situation and gave him an opportunity to play in the top six. We had Travis Dermott on the outside through training camp, and just made a decision that [Lehtonen] needed more time. That’s how it’s worked out. He’s definitely a talent and he worked really hard here and waited for his chance. I think, at the same time, we’ve got a number of other people in the organization that didn’t get the opportunity that Mikko had this season. It’ll open up more space and opportunity for them. At the same time, [Dubas] is able to find a place for Mikko to go — he’s an unrestricted free agent here at the end of the year. It’s a big year for him, so I think there’s something to be said for that as well. We wish him all the best."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/13/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-29-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Paul Maurice on his group performing poorly in shot- and chance-based metrics:,"There’s a whole bunch of different ways the puck can get to your net from that area. I think your opponent has something to do with it. There are teams that generate a lot of slot shots that you never consider particularly dangerous — those are just on the outside, poor angle shots [where] a rebound doesn’t happen. What you don’t like are the slot shots that you don’t control. Every team has strengths and weaknesses — there are teams that do a really good job of controlling that slot, but they don’t win a lot of games, and then there are teams that win on that alone. You take a look at what your group is, what you’re good at, and where you excel. For us, that’s a challenge. We’ve known that for a while, and the advantage is we’ll score some goals without having a ton of slot shots. The offense that we do produce, it’s not from throwing pucks at the net all the time, but there are teams that do that. We’ve got more risk in our game than other teams, possibly, and we’re trying to get that right balance in to try to give our goalies a chance to be as good as they are."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/13/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-29-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Maurice on what the Leafs do well in the offensive zone:,"They do a real good job of creating a problem for you before the puck gets to the slot. You look at a lot of the one-on-one play that happens down low, and we want to have layers with that. We don’t want to be man-to-man in the corners where a guy can spin out. They make those plays, and there’s a skill to it. The other thing to it is: There’s a real willingness on that team now that maybe we didn’t see in years past to go to the net. It holds the [defenseman] and turns it into a four-on-four game, which they really excel at. Looking at the areas that we need to improve, they’re very strong in those areas."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/01/craig-berube-on-the-maple-leafs-performance-in-a-3-2-win-over-the-rangers/,On the team’s performance:,"A little lacklustre, in my opinion, but we found a way to get a win. I didn’t think we generated enough offensively or got to our game tonight with our forecheck and our hard play down low in the offensive zone. It was in and out too quickly. We spent too much time in our own end. The penalty killing was really good. The goaltending was really good. I thought our D battled hard back there. We didn’t do enough with the puck. We did a lot of good things defensively tonight. We blocked shots, and our sticks were good. We kept a lot of their shots on the outside, in my opinion, but we have to get up ice and play. We have to get our forecheck going. It is a big part of our game and has been all year. It just wasn’t there tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/01/craig-berube-on-the-maple-leafs-performance-in-a-3-2-win-over-the-rangers/,On shifting Morgan Rielly to the top unit of the power play partway through the game:,"There was just nothing happening. There wasn’t anything going on with that unit. The other unit has done a good job for us. We just wanted to make a switch to put Mitch down low by the net to make some plays from below the goal line. We really didn’t get set up. We have to work harder on our power play. In my opinion, we are not competing hard enough. We are not digging in. On the power play, it is not just about making plays. You have to do other things, too, to make it successful. Right now, we have to dig in a lot more on our PP."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/01/craig-berube-on-the-maple-leafs-performance-in-a-3-2-win-over-the-rangers/,On the play of his blue line without Chris Tanev:,"I thought our D were good tonight. They battled hard. We talked about getting pucks going north from our zone. They rimmed a lot of pucks — I get it — but that is what we asked them to do. They defended the front of our net pretty well. For me, they were pretty solid. Without Tanev, our PK did a good job. I was pleased with our defense."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/01/craig-berube-on-the-maple-leafs-performance-in-a-3-2-win-over-the-rangers/,On Ryan Reaves’ first game back in the lineup since Feb. 4:,I thought he played good minutes for us. He was physical and made strong puck plays. We got good minutes out of him. He did a good job for us.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/01/craig-berube-on-the-maple-leafs-performance-in-a-3-2-win-over-the-rangers/,On whether Anthony Stolarz has exceeded his expectations this season:,"I don’t know if I had expectations. He has been put into a role now where he is one of our starters and is playing a lot of games. He did a good job in Florida when he played and won a lot of games there. For me, I didn’t have a ton of expectations on either of our goalies, but they have both played extremely well."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/01/craig-berube-on-the-maple-leafs-performance-in-a-3-2-win-over-the-rangers/,On Stolarz’s willingness to be vocal from the net:,"He is very vocal (in the crease), and he’s vocal in the locker room, too, at times. He sees everything and sees the game well from the net. He lets our players know what is going on."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-rangers-game-59-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Ryan Reaves on his anticipation for his return to the lineup:,It’s been a month. We’re playing against an old team in a fun arena that is always buzzing. It’s going to be fun.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-rangers-game-59-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Reaves on his memories from fighting Matt Rempe last season:,"Just how tall he was. You hear about how tall somebody is, and then you get up in front of him. He looks a little taller than I imagined. But it’s nothing I’ve never fought before."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-rangers-game-59-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Auston Matthews on his energy levels coming off of 4 Nations:,"I feel fine. It was good to get three wins in three games. I’m getting looks. There have been a couple of posts. It is a little frustrating at times, but we are playing well. We could’ve been better in some areas, but coming off a break that long and winning three games — including a big comeback win the other night — is huge. We want to keep the momentum going."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-rangers-game-59-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Matthews on whether this is the most frustrating run of goal-scoring luck of his career:,"I have definitely had some similar ones, but it is fine. We are winning games. I am getting the opportunities. It is all you can ask for. One is going to go in. Everything will settle down."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-rangers-game-59-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Matthews on the loss of Chris Tanev to injury:,"He is a tough customer. In every game, he blocks a shot, and you think, “That can’t possibly feel good. Something has to be broken.” But he just competes. Unfortunately, he is at a point where he can’t play right now, but he is such a big part of this team with the role he plays on the backend and the minutes he eats up against the other team’s top players and top lines. We have dealt with injuries throughout the year. It is an opportunity for other guys to step up and fill the void with more opportunity."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-rangers-game-59-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Matthews on the challenge of solving Igor Shesterkin in the Rangers’ net:,"He is just never out of it. You think you might have him, but he is so athletic. He might not be the biggest guy, but he has great angles. He is extremely athletic and anticipates the play and pucks very well. It is always a challenge. We have kind of gone back and forth throughout the years, but he is definitely one of the top goalies in the game."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-rangers-game-59-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Rangers head coach Peter Laviolette on the challenge presented by theLeafs:,"They’re an offensive team. They have high-end skill and firepower. We are going to have to make sure we are playing defensively, but the teams we have played recently are capable of scoring a lot of goals as well. Buffalo scored a lot of goals recently. The Islanders’ offense has been pretty good lately. It seems like every night you get an opponent with some players you have to be mindful of, and Toronto certainly fits that situation. It’s about making sure we are doing the right things defensively."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-rangers-game-59-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Laviolette on whether the energy levels of his 4 Nations participants have been lower than the rest of the team:,"They left a big stage with big games. To me, coming back is an emotional thing. It is not that it is not important here, but everybody watched those games. Everyone watched the first one, the second one, and all of the games. Certainly, the US-Canadian game drew a lot of attention, and with that came a lot of emotion. It’s just like inside of an overtime of a playoff game. I think our guys have come in and played pretty well. We have gotten some wins here. There was a game where we weren’t on point, but we are long past that and are looking for a good game tonight. We do try to be mindful of fatigue as well and try to control it as best we can. It was an optional skate this morning, and most likely, everyone who was on the ice yesterday isn’t going out with regard to those [4 Nations] players."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vancouver-canucks-game-25-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Mitch Marner on the HEM line:,"I think that whole line is [a bit] of a juggernaut line with the speed it’s got on it. You put [Mikheyev], [Engvall], and [Hyman] together, it’s three guys that can work really well — guys that are hungry for the puck. On the forecheck, [they’re] a bunch of dogs, really. It’s been fun to watch those three go to work, especially these last few games. All three of them are starting to get some really good chemistry going, and it’s nice to see them get rewarded as well."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vancouver-canucks-game-25-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Sheldon Keefe on what he wants from his bottom-six forwards:,"Production from those lines is very important, of course. When we get contributions from those guys, it certainly helps and is welcome. However, what it means to me is that we expect those guys to be the standard for us in terms of the execution of the systems, the structure, the competitiveness, and the work ethic. They have to be really, really good in those areas. Obviously, you [give] your top guys a little more freedom and they’re doing the things that they get paid for and that make them special and elite. We need to have models of consistency [when it comes to] structure with those lines. That’s really what we’re looking for. It’s something we talk a lot about. We’ve had a lot of contributions from our depth through the season and we love that. We want to make sure there’s no sacrifice in those areas."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vancouver-canucks-game-25-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on Morgan Rielly’s progression in 2021:,"I think he’s been really good. I think he’s been playing with a lot of assertiveness offensively and defensively. Offensively, he’s at his best when he’s using his legs and skating by people, getting into the rush, and giving us that extra option coming out of our zone. [When he] gets moving around in the offensive zone, those are the things that make him who he is and we like that about him and what it brings to our team. Defensively, closing on people in our own zone and maintaining a tighter gap are two things that we’ve talked a lot to him about. He’s really been committed to that. I think our defense as a whole has done a really good job for us throughout this season. The small improvements that Morgan has shown have really added to what is already a very good and established defenseman in the NHL."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/04/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-38-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Chris Tanev on preparing to play the Leafs:,"You’ve got to be firing on all cylinders against them. They don’t give up much [or] many odd-man rushes, so you’ve got to play a 2-1 game — 1-0, 2-0. They play such a structured game defensively. They forecheck extremely well, get a lot of pucks back, and they have a great power play. They’re doing all the right things right now, and we have to match that intensity and even step it up a level here."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/04/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-38-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Sheldon Keefe on Jack Campbell not starting and potentially giving him the night off:,"I think you can only go off of what we’ve seen here. The potential is great. He’s gaining more confidence and gaining more experience. As we’ve talked about, we have to continue to be smart with how we manage his workload despite the fact that we don’t have [Andersen] available."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/04/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-38-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on his team’s struggling power play:,"It’s obviously near the top of our list of things we need to sort out — we’ve got to get it going. We knew, coming into this road trip, we were playing Winnipeg and now Calgary — the two top penalty kills in our division. We knew it would be a difficult time to find our way out of [the slump]. At the very least, you’re looking for your powerplay to generate positive momentum for your team. Sometimes it’s not going to go in the net, but we’re not generating enough positive energy for our group coming out of the power play. The more we do that, the puck is going to find its way in. We’ve gone through [tactics]. That’s really where we’ve been at here the last number of weeks — we’ve been changing a number of things, probably too many things. We’ve been changing the tactics a little bit, changing the plan, then changing the personnel and moving things around quite a bit. That’s something that we’ve talked about — we need to get back to what had worked for us. We started this trip out [by] kind of loading up the one unit and giving that a go. We just didn’t like that. We’re just settling back into how we started the season, which was very successful for us. Having two groups, working with each group individually, having a little bit of a different plan for each group and just really looking to build that chemistry that has kind of lost its way here — partially to injuries we went through with Matthews and Simmonds — and then chasing it from there… We’re just looking to get some more cohesion."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/04/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-38-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on Ilya Mikheyev and his linemates:,"I would say that he’s giving us consistent energy and consistent speed. He’s been good for us on the penalty kill, finding ways to generate chances. I would say I’m happy with it. I think what I’m looking for is that line to come together. I feel like when that line — with Engvall there, or Kerfoot, whoever we’ve had with [him] — we need them to be rolling for us. Mikheyev is a big part of that, so when he’s at his best, that line tends to go. We want to continue what he’s doing, but also finding ways for the chemistry of the line to really come together. Like we’ve seen with Engvall and Hyman when they’re there, that is three players with similar types of skillsets in terms of being able to forecheck, turn pucks over, be hard to take it from. That line is a difference-maker for us. Simmonds has the ability to do that as well. I’m focusing on individuals, of course, but I’m also focusing on how our lines can come together here. We’d like to see Mikheyev work with his linemates a little bit better."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-23-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,"In lineup news, there will be a few unanswered questions until closer to game time. Auston Matthews, who missed Saturday’s game but has remained with the team and has been practicing, is a ‘game-time decision’. Given the injury appears to be to Mattews’ hand/wrist, the team could be taking extra precautions to keep him out longer:","Matthews didn't look to be taking many hard shots at practice yesterday either. He is still a game-time decision for tonight.https://t.co/RVzUU4E0eY — Kristen Shilton (@kristen_shilton)March 1, 2021"

https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-23-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Sheldon Keefe on Zach Bogosian’s progression this season:,"I thought that in the early going, you could tell he was still adjusting to be here in our system and in his role, but I think, for quite some time now, he’s really settled in and he’s provided what we thought and expected to get [from him]. [He’s] been a reliable defender who has brought a level of physicality to our defensive group. He’s a reliable penalty killer and just a great personality — a great person who’s added to the leadership of our team with the experience he has in the league. Of course, coming off of a Stanley Cup win and all those types of things, he’s definitely brought a lot."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-23-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on Mitch Marner’s dominance this season:,"Mitch is a very good player in both ends of the ice, first of all. When you’re looking and linemates and teammates, [the first thing is] do you do your job? Are you reliable in that? Mitch certainly is. If someone makes a mistake, can you make up for it through effort or intelligence? Mitch has both. Of course, when he has the puck, the way he sees it — if you get open, he finds you and creates his own space. That’s really what good players do. It comes back around, the chemistry he and Auston have shown this season along with Joe."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-23-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on T.J Brodie’s consistent impact this season:,"I like that he just doesn’t care who he’s playing against. It doesn’t rattle him, it doesn’t concern him. He’s comfortable in his own game and realizes that he’s got to stay within his skill set and do what works for him. He does it differently than other players, and that’s part of what’s made him successful in the league. The other part of it is, even if he gets beat or makes a mistake, he’s just going to go back and drink some water and give it his best shot the next time out. It more often than not works out for him. That’s why he is who he is in the league."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-23-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on the importance of Pierre Engvall and his growing role:,"With Pierre, we see great potential there. We’ve seen it before — I saw it with theMarlies, and I saw it last season at different points when he played for us. He didn’t start the [play-in] series against Columbus, but he came in and played down the middle and did a really nice job for us on that fourth line. We knew, and I knew, he was going to be an important piece for our team here this season. We’ve made things harder on him to earn that opportunity, mainly because I just feel like a player with his skillset, size, speed, physicality and the potential he has — I don’t even know if he realizes how good he can be. We didn’t want to hand him anything. He needed to work at it and he needed to understand that there are areas of his game he can continue to get better at. Even in the game the other night, I thought he did a terrific job and that line was excellent. There’s still a number of things in his game that show me room for growth and improvement. That’s exciting for me as a coach and for us as a team. It should be exciting for him as well. We gave him a slower start to this season here and created some adversity for him to really try to get the absolute best out of him when his opportunity came, which, for me, was inevitable."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-23-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Oilers head coach Dave Tippett on adapting to different play styles within the division:,"There’s situations in each game that dictate [what happens]. You’re on transition, you get openings — if you’re [playing against] structure, real tight structure, you have to read and react. That’s just part of the game. It goes both ways."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-23-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Tippett on the baseball-style schedule this season:,"You go into the series and you do a little pre-scout, but you make adjustments as you go along each game. It’s a unique situation; it’s more like a playoff-style mentality. I think the players enjoy it. I think they like having the ability to get into a kind of mini-series and get ingrained in it and know who you’re playing against to make those subtle adjustments that happen in a series."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-game-60-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Craig Berube on the challenge presented by the Penguins:,"They have a good power play. They have some great players over there who have been around for a long time. They generate a lot of offense. They come at you with a lot of pressure and shoot a lot of pucks. Especially with Karlsson and Letang up there, they fire a lot of pucks. They’re a good team around the net. They are an aggressive hockey team. They come at you and don’t give you a lot of time and space anywhere."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-game-60-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Berube on the keys to victory against a tired Penguins team:,"We don’t get a lot of afternoon games. We have to start on time. Early on in the game, it’s about simplifying the game and not putting yourself in positions to turn pucks over. It’s a simple game. Get it in deep. Let’s put pressure on them. They played yesterday. Let’s put pressure on them. That has to be our mindset: a hounding mindset. Keep the shifts short, roll the next line out there, and get after them that way. For me, it is about shot attempts. Let’s get shots. Let’s shoot pucks. It’s not a bad play to shoot a puck today."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-game-60-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan on his experience coaching Auston Matthews at 4 Nations:,"I didn’t know Auston very well going into that experience. To get to know him personally and to watch his game closer, I was so impressed with his leadership and how he leads by example. He is not an overly vocal guy or a “rah rah” guy. That is not his personality, but the way he competes and his 200-foot game… I was so impressed with his game away from the puck and his commitment to playing defense. He knows what winning hockey is all about. That is the takeaway I came away with from watching him up close. It is his drive and passion. His work ethic in practice was terrific. He just leads by example. That is the kind of person that he is. I could tell early on that he has an appetite to win, and he knows what it takes."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-game-60-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Sullivan on the keys for his team in a tired/back-to-back situation:,"I think our team has handled back-to-backs well this year. A lot of it is about playing a simple and smart game, making sure we don’t beat ourselves, managing the puck the right way, and watching our shift lengths. We are going to have to use the bench. For me, that is the most important part of it: We can’t beat ourselves. We have to manage the game. We have to take what is given out there."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-game-60-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Mitch Marner on his experience with Sidney Crosby as a teammate at 4 Nations:,"Just the leader he is, how he goes about his business, how locked in he is, and how dialed-in he is about everything… It was really cool to be his teammate for a few weeks. Everyone talks about his generosity and how much time he takes out of his day. It doesn’t matter who you are or where you are from. He takes time out of his day, hangs around, and talks about his experiences. We had a couple of team dinners that he was very generous with."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-game-60-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Berube on Calle Jarnkrok nearing a return (expected Monday vs. SJ):,"He brings a lot. He is a very structured player who can play all three positions. He touches a little bit of everything, in my opinion — penalty kill, and he has been used on the power play before. He is kind of a Swiss army knife. You can use him almost anywhere. He complements good hockey players. With skilled players, he does all of the little things for them at the net front, getting pucks out of the corners, and doing the little things for them."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-game-60-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Marner on Jarnkrok’s game:,The speed he brings off the puck opens up ice. He doesn’t sit around the side of the net. He gets to the front. He gets himself in goalies’ eyes a lot and opens up space for other guys. That’s what I’ve found when playing with him.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-game-60-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Marner on the mood around the team amid a four-game winning streak out of the break:,"It’s good. We are keeping it light, but at the same time, we know we haven’t played our best hockey still. We know we have better and have to be better. In saying that, we are keeping it light as well. I think our starts have been a little weak. Our second and thirds have been a lot better than our firsts. We are trying to get ready on time and get going, not wait until the second and third."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-game-60-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Berube on how the 4 Nations players’ energy levels are recovering:,"I have not seen their energy levels as low for the last couple of games, to be honest with you. They are playing good minutes. I don’t see it as an issue. I haven’t seen it for the last two games. They’re in good spots."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/25/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-ottawa-senators-game-33-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Sheldon Keefe on the team’s goal in the coming weeks:,"I think we’re just looking for greater consistency with all areas of our game, on both sides of the puck — special teams, and all those things. We’ve clearly shown at this point in the season that, no matter what area of the game it is, we’ve shown that we can do it very well. Many times when things have gotten away from us, we’ve lacked the consistency to keep doing it, so that’s really what we’re looking for here. Increased practice time and rest that we’ve had here in the last couple of weeks should help us in that regard, especially as the schedule heats back up. The challenge for us here today, especially against a team that played last night and is going to be rolling here off the start, is that we have to get back into that game mode really quickly."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/25/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-ottawa-senators-game-33-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on Brady Tkachuk:,"There are not many guys that play that role as well as he does. There are a lot of big, strong guys that go to the net, but [they] don’t necessarily have the skill set or the timing to make good on the chances. He’s definitely someone who is difficult to handle in that area. The challenge is trying to break out quickly and not let him or his line spend time in the offensive zone so he doesn’t have as much of an opportunity to use the skills that he has getting to the net. If you get back and get out clean, then you’re not having to play in our end and it takes away that strength from their game."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/25/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-ottawa-senators-game-33-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on the lack of injuries on the roster right now:,"It’s definitely a positive. We’ve fought injuries thus far in the first half of the season. I hope we can stay healthy for the rest of the way, of course. The schedule will take its toll on our team at some point ,and we’ve to be able to manage that, deal with that, and use our depth. We definitely want to take advantage of having this rested and healthy group here. It should certainly help our energy level and the way that we can roll four lines and six defensemen."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/25/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-ottawa-senators-game-33-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on how the Senators have progressed as a team this season:,"I just feel they’re a team that, as the season has worn on, has gotten a lot more comfortable with how it is they want to play and need to play. At the same time, they’re a very young team and their young players are gaining a lot of experience and they’ve gone through a lot. We have felt that, really from the start of the season, they’re a difficult team to play against. They’ve had a lot of nights where the game gets ahead of them early and they’ve had some difficulty getting some saves. Any time they’ve gotten those saves… they’re either winning games or are an extremely difficult team to beat. You’re really seeing that here now. Just to focus on the last 20 games, they’re really as good as any team in the division in that sense. It’s a team that, because of their start, people perhaps overlooked them, but if you watch their games and focus on them, they’re doing a lot of things. Obviously, [they] haven’t lost in regulation in five games here now. They’re a confident team and [probably] have played their best hockey against us, so we have every reason to be prepared here tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/25/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-ottawa-senators-game-33-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,D.J Smith on getting Braydon Coburn in on defense:,"Just back-to-back games, he hasn’t played. He’s someone who defends really well against a team that can score. He gives us a fresh guy back there that can help us keep it out tonight against what we think is one the highest-firing offenses in hockey."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/25/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-ottawa-senators-game-33-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Smith on his team’s mentality tonight:,"You’ve got to stay off the PK. You can’t give their power play extra looks — one or two penalties max. We’ve got to find a way to not give them high-end chances. If we do, they score. We have to have a defense-first mentality and try and limit their big guys’ touches."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/25/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-ottawa-senators-game-33-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Smith on Alex Forementon and what he brings to the PK:,"Speed kills in this league and he can fly. As his detail gets better, he’s going to be a really good NHL player. I wasn’t afraid to put him in defensive situations last night. I think his speed will be able to create some offense — not only now but for years to come."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-34-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Morgan Rielly on the Leafs’ success against the Oilers this year and what they need to do to continue that tonight:,"We didn’t allow too many odd-man rushes. I just thought we played to our structure. We made it tough for them going through the neutral zone, clogged it up pretty good, and I think we’re going to have to replicate that here tonight and on Monday night. We haven’t gone over too much. We obviously talked about what we did in those games that made us successful and what’s happened recently that’s caused a little bit of a slide. To prepare, you just a little bit about it and you just go out there and play. We know what we have to do. We know how we played during that stretch in Edmonton. It’s important that we look back on that those games and we bring that attitude tonight that we’re going to be good defensively and capitalize on our chances."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-34-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Sheldon Keefe on Jason Spezza’s faceoff ability:,"It’s been really handy, especially considering he’s a right-hand shot. That helps a lot on that dot, especially given all our centers are left-handed players. It’s been a big factor on the penalty kill. It’s helped us there a great deal. That’s another thing we utilized a little bit last season for sure, but we talked to him before camp this year about taking a bigger step in that regard."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-34-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on John Tavares’ progress defensively this season:,"It’s just recognizing when it’s time to play offense and when it’s time to defend. I think a lot of our players last season hung around a little bit too long on the offensive side of it. When it was time to defend, we delayed in that decision-making process. We needed to shorten that time and get back on defense quicker. I think he’s done a terrific job of that. It’s been a major improvement in that way. I think John would like to have more goals at five-on-five. He’s had a lot of opportunities to score those goals and it hasn’t gone in for him. While we have high expectations of him and he does of himself, I think, if you look around the league, he’s still in a pretty good place with where he is. There’s a lot of teams that he would be leading in scoring. He would be top two in over half of the league. He’s done a lot of really good things for us and he’s been a big reason why we are where we are through this season in the standings. All that being said, I think we’re obviously looking for ways to get him more involved on the offensive side without sacrificing on the other end."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2021/03/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-34-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on the lineup changes at forward tonight:,"A big part of it is I’ve been wanting to get Simmonds back with Tavares and Nylander — that’s a big one. I think that line to me, when Wayne left with his injury, was really just starting to get going. I think it’s the best trio we’ve had there — those guys were really going and had a lot of opportunities. Wayne was bringing a lot to the line, so I’ve been wanting to go back with that. For Galchenyuk, giving him a good opportunity was also important. I think we’ve got him in a good place here now and we’ve liked what he’s done. There’s nothing against what he’s brought to that line, but I’ve wanted to get Wayne in that space. Keeping that Engvall group together was important. Joe has played really good hockey against the Edmonton Oilers this season — defensively, especially. What he’s brought to those guys and how he’s played against Edmonton’s best players, he’s done a really good job. He’s been conscious of them being out there and how he needs to play."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/02/craig-berube-on-the-maple-leafs-wild-6-5-ot-win-in-pittsburgh/,On the wild game:,"It is not how we wanted to draw it up, but it happens sometimes. We made a couple of mistakes and put ourselves in a little bit of a hole, but the guys stayed with it, climbed out of it, and found a way to get a win, which is great. It is a little too high event of a game."

This guy is obviously a world-class player. He looked young out there to me. He is still playing at a high pace and playing the right way. He keeps driving. He is a great player.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/02/craig-berube-on-the-maple-leafs-wild-6-5-ot-win-in-pittsburgh/,On what the long road trips recently have done for the team:,"I said on the road trip before the break that I thought it was a really important trip at that time to get on the road with the guys only. It is all hockey, right? This is a similar trip. The guys are getting together on the road and being together — yelling together — a little bit more than being at home. We have been a good road team for quite a long time. We just have to keep doing it. We have one game at home, and then we are back on the road."

He is a great player and a great scorer. It was good to see him get one tonight. I know he has been snakebitten a bit, so it was nice. He had six shots on net. He is shooting, which is good. Congrats to him. Great accomplishment."

He was excited. He had a lot of energy out there. It was good to see. It is a big goal by him, and I thought that line was good tonight"
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/02/craig-berube-on-the-maple-leafs-wild-6-5-ot-win-in-pittsburgh/,On whether the long goal slump was weighing on Domi:,"I think it bothered him. It would bother any player. But he is a positive guy. He just stays with it, and he comes and plays. He is not a guy who complains about it. He puts it on himself. He keeps things internal. He doesn’t express too much about it. He just keeps playing and working at it. To me, since the break, he has played good hockey for us."
