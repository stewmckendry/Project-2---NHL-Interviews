He’s moved up alongside the Leafs’ top players before, including the left wing of Matthews and Marner last season and now Tavares and Nylander. We can see why it sometimes works; he’s a good worker who gets in on the forecheck and goes to the net. When he gets the puck, he will hold onto it and make plays. Against Carolina, he set up Nylander in the slot from behind the net. Against Chicago, he hit Nylander with a good backside pass. Also against Chicago, he was set up for a one-timer attempt of his own in the slot and whiffed on it.We’ve said it before, but Holmberg’s shot is where he needs to improve the most. He has just 46 shots on net in 45 games. Of his five goals, three are empty netters, one was Jordan Staal shooting it into his own net, and one was a shorthanded goal against the Devils that he swept along the ice from distance. The rest of the tools are there – and Craig Berube has said a few times he thinks there is more offense/skill than he’s shown at times – but he needs to work on his shot and produce more in general to become a regular up the lineup. As it is, he’s a versatile player who the Leafs can move around.","“They defend well. They block shots and make simple plays with the puck. They are in good positions to be on the offensive side of things and be plus players. It starts in our end with those guys, with how hard they are to play against. They have such good chemistry together and are so connected with each other, making little plays and moving the puck well. But it is the dirty work they do with the physical play, blocking shots, and defending the front of our net. They are really good at it.” –  Craig Berube on the Jake McCabe – Chris Tanev pairing"

https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/25/toronto-maple-leafs-notebook-atlantic-division-2/,"–   After a four-point weekend,Pontus Holmbergis up to 12 points in 45 games this year, a 22-point pace over 82 games. He’s moved up alongside the Leafs’ top players before, including the left wing of Matthews and Marner last season and now Tavares and Nylander. We can see why it sometimes works; he’s a good worker who gets in on the forecheck and goes to the net. When he gets the puck, he will hold onto it and make plays. Against Carolina, he set up Nylander in the slot from behind the net. Against Chicago, he hit Nylander with a good backside pass. Also against Chicago, he was set up for a one-timer attempt of his own in the slot and whiffed on it.We’ve said it before, but Holmberg’s shot is where he needs to improve the most. He has just 46 shots on net in 45 games. Of his five goals, three are empty netters, one was Jordan Staal shooting it into his own net, and one was a shorthanded goal against the Devils that he swept along the ice from distance. The rest of the tools are there – and Craig Berube has said a few times he thinks there is more offense/skill than he’s shown at times – but he needs to work on his shot and produce more in general to become a regular up the lineup. As it is, he’s a versatile player who the Leafs can move around.","“They defend well. They block shots and make simple plays with the puck. They are in good positions to be on the offensive side of things and be plus players. It starts in our end with those guys, with how hard they are to play against. They have such good chemistry together and are so connected with each other, making little plays and moving the puck well. But it is the dirty work they do with the physical play, blocking shots, and defending the front of our net. They are really good at it.” –  Craig Berube on the Jake McCabe – Chris Tanev pairing"
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/25/toronto-maple-leafs-notebook-atlantic-division-2/,It seems the Leafs are locking into thisJake McCabe–Chris Tanevpairing after a few weeks of splitting them up. It makes sense in a vacuum; they soak up tough minutes and are still up 26-15 in goals at five-on-five. The question for the Leafs: What becomes of the rest of the defense unit?,"“No, no, I won’t. Like I spoke about, Auston is my guy. He’s been my guy since day one. We’ve been through a lot of shit together. Unfortunately, we were against each other, but that’s the fun in these tournaments: you get to play against the guys that you really love.” –  Mitch Marner, when asked if he would rib Matthews after Canada beat the USA"
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/25/toronto-maple-leafs-notebook-atlantic-division-2/,Good onMitch Marnerfor shutting this question down. I thought it was a good answer worth sharing.,"“They’re outstanding—I mean, both of them. Any given night, you just trust them back there, and it gives our team so much confidence. Yeah, they were both awesome in Game 1 and Game 2 after the break. Awesome.” –  Max Domi on the Leafs’ goaltending"

https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/25/toronto-maple-leafs-notebook-atlantic-division-2/,"–   After a four-point weekend,Pontus Holmbergis up to 12 points in 45 games this year, a 22-point pace over 82 games. He’s moved up alongside the Leafs’ top players before, including the left wing of Matthews and Marner last season and now Tavares and Nylander. We can see why it sometimes works; he’s a good worker who gets in on the forecheck and goes to the net. When he gets the puck, he will hold onto it and make plays. Against Carolina, he set up Nylander in the slot from behind the net. Against Chicago, he hit Nylander with a good backside pass. Also against Chicago, he was set up for a one-timer attempt of his own in the slot and whiffed on it.We’ve said it before, but Holmberg’s shot is where he needs to improve the most. He has just 46 shots on net in 45 games. Of his five goals, three are empty netters, one was Jordan Staal shooting it into his own net, and one was a shorthanded goal against the Devils that he swept along the ice from distance. The rest of the tools are there – and Craig Berube has said a few times he thinks there is more offense/skill than he’s shown at times – but he needs to work on his shot and produce more in general to become a regular up the lineup. As it is, he’s a versatile player who the Leafs can move around.","“They defend well. They block shots and make simple plays with the puck. They are in good positions to be on the offensive side of things and be plus players. It starts in our end with those guys, with how hard they are to play against. They have such good chemistry together and are so connected with each other, making little plays and moving the puck well. But it is the dirty work they do with the physical play, blocking shots, and defending the front of our net. They are really good at it.” –  Craig Berube on the Jake McCabe – Chris Tanev pairing"
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/25/toronto-maple-leafs-notebook-atlantic-division-2/,It seems the Leafs are locking into thisJake McCabe–Chris Tanevpairing after a few weeks of splitting them up. It makes sense in a vacuum; they soak up tough minutes and are still up 26-15 in goals at five-on-five. The question for the Leafs: What becomes of the rest of the defense unit?,"“No, no, I won’t. Like I spoke about, Auston is my guy. He’s been my guy since day one. We’ve been through a lot of shit together. Unfortunately, we were against each other, but that’s the fun in these tournaments: you get to play against the guys that you really love.” –  Mitch Marner, when asked if he would rib Matthews after Canada beat the USA"
