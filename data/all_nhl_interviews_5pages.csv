https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-carolina-hurricanes-game-43-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,"On defense, Morgan Rielly will shift next to Chris Tanev and Oliver Ekman-Larsson next to Philippe Myers (a new pairing this season),a move Anthony Petrielli advocated for in his recent notebook:","With Jake McCabe on IR, I’d like to see a bit more of a shake-up… The OEL-Tanev pairing wasn’t particularly strong in terms of driving play up ice, and they didn’t really bring out the best in each other (OEL wasn’t potent offensively, and Tanev wasn’t dictating play up ice as he normally does). I’d rather try Rielly-Tanev as a top pairing, considering they already saw time together and meshed much more naturally to me. It would then bump OEL to play with Myers while keeping the Benoit – Timmins pairing together. There is still familiarity with two of those pairings, and I think the combo of Rielly-Tanev gives them the best possible pairing overal. But it’s possible the other two pairings won’t be good enough to allow them to keep Rielly and Tanev together, and Tanev shouldn’t be playing 22+ minutes at this point. Still, I’d like a longer look at this pairing."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-carolina-hurricanes-game-43-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Rod Brind’Amour on Craig Berube’s coaching style:,"He never took a shift off, and that’s carried over into his coaching. It doesn’t matter if you’re a great player or a fringe player; there is an expectation to play hard every shift. That’s non-negotiable. He went to the wall for his teammates when he played. He would stand up for anybody. That doesn’t change when you’re a coach. I’m sure it’s the same. I think the players understand that, and that’s why they respect you. The biggest thing in coaching is getting that respect from your players. If they respect you and they respect what you’re talking about, they’ll play hard for you and try to do what you want. That seems to be the case with him and his players."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-carolina-hurricanes-game-43-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on Rod Brind’Amour’s coaching success in Carolina:,"He has done a great job here. How he played as a player is what he has brought to the team: the work ethic, they’re a great faceoff team — Roddy was a great faceoff guy — and a great penalty killer. He was a good power-play guy, too. He was good in all facets of the game. He has brought that to his team. His teams are about pressure and work. They don’t give you any time or space."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-carolina-hurricanes-game-43-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Steven Lorentz on his memories of playing for Brind’Amour in Carolina:,"I learned a lot. It was how I broke into the league. He is a tremendous coach and a guy who has played well over 1,000 games. He has seen everything and been there, done that. It is easy to learn from a guy who has been through those experiences. He made it so easy to play for him as long as you were playing hard. He was one of my favourite coaches. I definitely miss him, but he is the enemy tonight, so I am not going to take it easy on him tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-carolina-hurricanes-game-43-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Lorentz on the similarities between Brind’Amour and Berube’s coaching styles:,"There are a lot, actually, and same with Paul Maurice last year. You play hard. You have your systems you fall back on and rely on, and you definitely need that structure, but at the end of the day, hockey is a game of mistakes. As long as you are making those mistakes when doing things hard — Brind’Amour preached that, and Berube preaches it, too. It is all about putting your foot to the gas. Mistakes are going to happen, but it is about playing through that."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-carolina-hurricanes-game-43-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the challenge presented by the Hurricanes:,"They’ve always been a tough opponent. They’ve been a really good team for a while now. They have some great players over there. It’s the pressure they come with. They’re a hard-working team. They work as hard as any team in the league. There is just no room. They don’t give you much room. You have to win your battles. There are a few things we have to do to try to create some space out there tonight and be patient. Composure, patience, and discipline are going to be key in this game."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-carolina-hurricanes-game-43-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on assembling a Morgan Rielly-Chris Tanev pairing:,"A lot of it is [Carolina’s] lineup. They are pretty spread out with three lines. We need some balance with our D pairs tonight going against them. They have some good skill on each line with size — Necas, Svechhnikov, Staal. They have it spread out pretty well."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-carolina-hurricanes-game-43-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Rielly on joining a pairing with Tanev:,"We want to play well together, move the puck, and not spend too much time in the defensive zone. When there are D who are out, things get shifted around, and you play with different guys. Chris and I want to be strong defensively and move the puck quickly to get going up ice."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-carolina-hurricanes-game-43-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on reinserting Nick Robertson and Pontus Holmberg and scratching Max Pacioretty:,"A little more speed tonight. It is going to be a fast game. We talked about it before when guys sit out, and we want to get them back in. Holmberg has been sitting for a bit. He was sick, and he is back now. I wanted to make the switch."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-carolina-hurricanes-game-43-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Matthew Knies on the recent success of his line with Auston Matthews and Mitch Marner:,"I like our competitiveness. We are working hard and getting pucks back from their D. Our forecheck has been really good, and we have been capitalizing on our chances."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-carolina-hurricanes-game-43-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Knies on the keys to success for the five-forward power play against a top-ranked Hurricanes PK:,Keep it simple. Get it to the net. Try to create havoc. We need to not do too much and stick to the simple stuff. That is going to reward us.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/12/team-canada-vs-team-sweden-4-nations-face-off-projected-lines-discussion-tv-info/,MitchMarner on the opportunity to play with Connor McDavid after matching up against him so often as a kid:,"It was hard to keep him to three points back in the day, realistically. It was always a lot of fun to play against him because you knew you were going to get the best player. It is not a surprise to see what he is doing now. The first one was probably when I played for the Whitby Wildcats, and he was on York Simcoe. I don’t know how old we would’ve been there. I remember that we had a final against each other, and he got the upper hand in it. It was for the OMHA Championship or something. It was a tough one. He has always had that speed and skill set. He has just continued to get better and better. It’s been [really] impressive."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/12/team-canada-vs-team-sweden-4-nations-face-off-projected-lines-discussion-tv-info/,Marner on the challenge against Team Sweden:,"Every team in the tournament has a lot of skill and can make plays. It is about staying patient through the game, knowing that it is not going to be an easy one in any of the games. You are going to have to work for it. When you get opportunities, try not to miss."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/12/team-canada-vs-team-sweden-4-nations-face-off-projected-lines-discussion-tv-info/,Marner on the opportunity to seek revenge after a loss to Wiliam Nylander and Team Sweden in the World Championships back in 2017:,"We have played against each other before in these kinds of events. It is always great to play against your teammates. There is always a bit of chirping going on. It is going to be a fun one. With the Worlds, some guys can’t be there. That is why this tournament is really exciting. It is best-on-best. We have everyone here. That is what you are looking forward to."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/12/team-canada-vs-team-sweden-4-nations-face-off-projected-lines-discussion-tv-info/,Marner on the key to shutting down Nylander:,"Try not to watch the puck. He likes to make people look silly. He is very, very skilled out there. He is smooth with the puck and makes a lot of things happen when it doesn’t look like something should be there."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/12/team-canada-vs-team-sweden-4-nations-face-off-projected-lines-discussion-tv-info/,Marner on the opportunity to play at the Bell Center as the home team:,It will be nice to be on their side for once. It will be nice to be cheered for rather than booed and yelled at.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/12/team-canada-vs-team-sweden-4-nations-face-off-projected-lines-discussion-tv-info/,William Nylander on who he is looking forward to playing with the most on Team Sweden:,"There are obviously a bunch of incredible players, but I have seen Victor Hedman a lot through the years on the other side. It will be fun to play with him."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/12/team-canada-vs-team-sweden-4-nations-face-off-projected-lines-discussion-tv-info/,Nylander on his past experience playing against Mitch Marner at the World Championships:,"Was that the time we won? Yeah, so it was obviously a lot of fun playing against him. We won that won, so hopefully we win again."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/12/team-canada-vs-team-sweden-4-nations-face-off-projected-lines-discussion-tv-info/,Nylander on whether there is a way to key in on Marner:,"It is so hard to say he does one particular thing. He is very, very shifty and hard to read."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/12/team-canada-vs-team-sweden-4-nations-face-off-projected-lines-discussion-tv-info/,Nylander on whether he considered competing for Team Canada as a Calgary-born kid:,"From when I was a kid, I always considered myself Swedish. When I realized I was good enough to compete for the junior national team, I wasn’t even thinking about playing for Canada or anything, although that was an option, too, if you look back at it at the time."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/12/team-canada-vs-team-sweden-4-nations-face-off-projected-lines-discussion-tv-info/,Nylander on the atmosphere he is anticipating in the Bell Centre tonight:,"Probably something like aLeafsvs. Habs game here. Very amped up, and a lot of fun. You are buzzing going into the game. Very exciting."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/12/team-canada-vs-team-sweden-4-nations-face-off-projected-lines-discussion-tv-info/,Nylander on the feeling of pulling on the Tre Kronor jersey:,"It is similar to the feeling of putting on theLeafsjersey. What an honour to play for your country and for theLeafs. I am just proud to represent them, and you want to put your best foot forward."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/12/team-canada-vs-team-sweden-4-nations-face-off-projected-lines-discussion-tv-info/,Jon Cooper on the questions from the outside about Team Canada’s goaltending:,"We get asked questions about forwards, defense, and goaltending. Everybody plays their positions. Ultimately, it is a team sport. That is it. When a goal is scored, for the most part, it is usually not the goalie’s fault, but he always gets the rap because he is the last one who sees it. He is the one who has to dig it out of the net when it is in there. Usually, there has been a progression of a blown backcheck, a missed hit, or some system breakdown all the way to the end. The goaltender, for 65 shot attempts and 30 shots at him a game, has to make the save. I don’t get into [that]. I look at the guys and say, “Well, that guy has won a Cup, and that guy has won a Cup.” I look over somewhere else and say, “He hasn’t won a Cup, and he hasn’t won a Cup.” You put guys in big-time situations, and it is about how they perform. On our team, we feel that we have a whole bunch of guys who have performed in pressure situations all the way through our lineup, but this is a team sport, man. You win and lose as a team. I feel that we are sold in every single position. I sleep well at night, thinking that I have this team to stand behind the bench with. I am excited about it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/12/team-canada-vs-team-sweden-4-nations-face-off-projected-lines-discussion-tv-info/,Cooper on the level of pace and competitiveness he anticipates in tonight’s matchup:,"Hard to say. Because this is an entirely NHL event, all of the players know each other. Yesterday, it was a picture day, and teams were walking through the same hallways. Everybody is stopping each other and chatting. It is not an All-Star game feel, but everybody is talking to each other. Behind closed doors, I don’t think that is what is going on. I expect it to be as competitive as any international tournament. The difference is that we are all together right now. Teams are sharing hotels, so you are running into different situations like that. It is exactly how the bubble was. Everybody was together and having fun and conversing, but when those games started, it was a war. The only thing that was crazy was that there were no fans. After one period, you never noticed it anyway because of the competitiveness on the ice. I think this will be the same way."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/05/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-philadelphia-flyers-game-41-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the challenge presented by the Flyers:,"A very hard-working team and competitive team. They are probably one of the quickest teams we will see this year in transition. From defense to offense, they are gone. They are very active. They get up the ice very quickly. And they are highly competitive."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/05/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-philadelphia-flyers-game-41-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on Dennis Hildeby’s return to the crease after a brief spell in the AHL:,"He is still a young guy who is learning, but he has battled for us when he has been in there this year. He plays with confidence. Great size in net. Again, he is still learning, but he is learning in the NHL right now."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/05/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-philadelphia-flyers-game-41-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the team’s first half as the schedule hits the 41-game mark:,"We have been in a lot of tight games this year, which is a good thing. We’re learning how to win those games when going into third periods with leads and playing a good period — a low-event third. We are not shooting ourselves in the foot. A lot of good things have happened in the first half, and there are obviously things we need to keep improving on. We can’t get complacent."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/05/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-philadelphia-flyers-game-41-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the areas for improvement in the second half:,"Rush defense is always a concern for every team — it is such a fast league, and teams transition so quickly. The D are always up in the play. Better sort outs, and there are some times when we can manage the puck better and not give opportunities to teams the other way. We are getting better at it. Trust me, I think our team has bought into putting the puck in deep and going to work, but there is still improvement that can be made."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/05/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-philadelphia-flyers-game-41-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Max Pacioretty on the team’s energy level heading into yet another back-to-back:,"I think the energy has been really good. There are points in the year when maybe it hasn’t been as good with the schedule and whatnot, but I feel like the boys are coming back to life in the last couple of games and are playing with some confidence. It is crazy how powerful the mind is. It makes these back-to-backs a little bit… I don’t want to say it’s easier, but it’s easier to keep your energy when things are going well. Things have been going pretty well lately. We like the way our game is trending. We know there are areas to improve, but it helps the energy levels as well."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/05/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-philadelphia-flyers-game-41-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Pacioretty on the team’s first half:,"I like that it hasn’t been perfect. When it doesn’t go well, we have found ways to win. We have found ways to correct our mistakes in games that we have lost. For the top teams, it is never perfect early. When you go through a little bit of adversity in terms of style of play and whatnot, you realize what works and what doesn’t work, what works in tight games, and what doesn’t work in tight games. Some games are played that feel like playoff games, and we have to change our approach a little bit. We have done a really good job of that thus far."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/05/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-philadelphia-flyers-game-41-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Pacioretty on Matthew Knies’ impact:,"People have often mentioned how big and strong he is. When guys come into the league, that is one of the areas they most often want to improve. He is almost the opposite of that, where he is already big and strong. He uses his body really well also. In the playoffs, guys who take defenders wide make for a long night and a long series. When someone like Kniesy is protecting the puck and bringing it hard to the paint, it is really hard to play against. It makes teams come back and stop in their own end, which is also very tiring. A big part of this team and the way we want to play is the way he has been playing as of late."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/05/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-philadelphia-flyers-game-41-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Simon Benoit on Jake McCabe ending the 16-game goal-less drought for theLeafs‘ defense in Saturday’s 6-4 win over Boston:,"Jake and I had a running bet that the first to score gets $100. I just lost $100 yesterday. On that note, when we can contribute, it is always fun. Especially for me, I have a stay-at-home job. I need to focus on not getting scored on. When we can contribute offensively, it is always fun."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/05/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-philadelphia-flyers-game-41-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,"John Tortorella on tonight’s starter in the Flyers’ net, rookie Ivan Fedotov, who hasn’t played since Dec. 5:","It’s a hell of a spot that we’re putting him in, and he’s handled himself really well. He’s practiced well. I think the onus is on us to help him, against a really good team offensively, to make sure we’re playing strong in front of him."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/05/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-philadelphia-flyers-game-41-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Tortorella on the message to his team coming off of a 5-2 loss to Vegas:,"On the road trip we are on, I think we could’ve gotten points in all of the games. I need to approach the team and how we play, not just the result. As coaches now, we have to relay that message now that we have played some good hockey. We just have to stay within ourselves. We have to be extra focused as far as being as strong as we can be in front of Fed as he gets his feet on the ice. We’ll go from there."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-game-37-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Capitals head coach Spencer Carbery on his team’s 3-1 win over theLeafsin early December:,"I thought it was one of our better games of the year. Coming into this building, we knew the challenge in front of us at the time, and it is no different tonight. You know they will be ready. It is fresh in their minds what happened that night and how we played. We were able to get to our game for good portions of that 60 minutes. We need to be ready, and we need to do a lot of the same things."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-game-37-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Carbery on the differences in theMaple Leafs‘ game under Craig Berube:,"A couple of things. You are going to have to work your way through the forecheck pressure because you know they are going to put a ton of pucks in behind you. It may seem like an easy accomplishment to just break the forecheck pressure, but when they do it time and time and time again, eventually, they are hoping you crack one or two times. We have to stay consistent with our breakout structure, support it, and find ways to advance out of our zone. The other thing, which is maybe a little bit to do with the moves that they made with adding OEL and Taev: They defend the interior of the rink as well as anybody. Everyone talks about the goalies and how they’re having great years, but a lot of it is them protecting the inside of the rink. It is so hard to get in there with A) people and B) to get pucks delivered in there. They really push you to have to earn your offense against them at five-on-five."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-game-37-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Carbery on the boost from the return of Alex Ovechkin to the lineup:,"The obvious one is the goal scoring, but I even think the threat of him being able to score lifts up our entire group. There is his presence, his infectious personality, and his demeanour. When he is on the ice — whether it is a power play, a faceoff, at five-on-five, or any moment — everybody in the building, along with our 19 other players, believes he can score. That lifts our entire group up."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-game-37-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the challenge presented by the Capitals:,"They are a very good team. If you look down the center ice, it is a deep center group. It is big, and their team has great size. I thought they added some defensemen who really drove their team up. Their goalies have been good. They play a good brand of hockey. It is very direct. I always say, “How do you want your team to look?” The Capitals get on a nightly basis how they want their team to look."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-game-37-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Chris Tanev on building on the momentum of last night’s 5-2 win over Detroit:,"It is a good start. The two previous games weren’t how we wanted to play. It was good to get back to defending well, checking, and not giving up a bunch of chances against."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-game-37-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Tanev on the challenge presented by the Capitals:,"They play a really good team game. If you look at their defense, they have six really good defensemen who move the puck well and skate well. Obviously, they have guys who can put the puck in the net. When everyone buys into what they are preaching over there, it translates."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-game-37-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Tanev on the challenge of shutting down Alex Ovechkin:,"Obviously, he is the second-best shooter ever right now and potentially in the future will have the most goals. You don’t want to give him shots or opportunities in the scoring areas. It takes all five guys to help out and then have good sticks and know where he is all the time."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-game-37-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Tanev on whether an Ovechkin shot hurts more to block:,They all hurt.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/23/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-chicago-blackhawks-game-57-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Interim Blackhawks head coach Anders Sorensen on his team’s source of motivation in a non-competitive season:,"That is a good question. You have pride, right? You have pride as a player. You have pride as a group. Let’s be honest. There are a lot of guys who are playing for their future here, whether it is for us or for someone else. You have to be ready to go. It is a business. That is where it is at. You have to take pride in what you are doing. I don’t think it should matter where you are in the standings at this point. You have to take pride in what you are doing if you are a pro. That is the biggest part of it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/23/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-chicago-blackhawks-game-57-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Craig Berube on the keys to victory against this Chicago team:,"We have to focus on ourselves and how we want to start the game and play the game. That is the bottom line. We have to get to our game as quickly as possible and play it. We have to be competitive… They have good special teams — both the PK and the power play — with some guys who can put the puck in the net. They can make plays, starting with their guy, Bedard. They make plays in the offensive zone. They do a lot of good things with the puck making plays. There are a lot of low plays around the net. We have to check well tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/23/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-chicago-blackhawks-game-57-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Berube on the performance of the Holmberg – Tavares – Nylander line in the win over Carolina:,"They had a great first period. They had the puck a lot in the offensive zone and made plays. They did a lot of good things. They had good chemistry last night together. They had a strong game for us, and we’ll need them to do the same tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/23/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-chicago-blackhawks-game-57-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Berube on the challenge of playing a back-to-back out of the long break:,"Getting that first game out of the way, the timing could be better today. A lot of times, in back-to-backs this year, we’ve had good energy. After the 10-day layoff — or whatever it was — tonight, you could see some better execution and some better timing."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/23/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-chicago-blackhawks-game-57-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Jake McCabe on the importance of not overlooking the Blackhawks:,"Anybody can beat anybody in this league. They have a lot of talented players. Some of them I am really familiar with and have played with recently, and Bedard can really shoot and is dangerous off the rush. We have to check really hard. That is our game: checking and forechecking, and I like our starts if we do that."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/24/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-carolina-hurricanes-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Sheldon Keefe on the decision to reinsert TJ Brodie as well as the return of Ilya Lyubushkin on the blue line:,"We just figured, with the back-to-back, it makes sense to utilize our depth not unlike we did in the earlier back-to-back. It is a good chance to get Brodie and Lyubushkin back involved."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/24/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-carolina-hurricanes-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Keefe on the message to Brodie ahead of his first game coming off of back-to-back healthy scratches:,"Just go out and play. A chance to watch the team compete on a night like last night is a good example of what we are looking for from all of our defense in terms of being competitive below our circles and helping us move the puck up the ice. He knows how to play the game. We are just hopeful that a little bit of time away gives him a chance to reboot, get back out, and compete against a tough team today. It is a chance for us to continue to utilize our depth, which I think is extremely important. The more injuries and illnesses that we have faced, the more that we have learned about the value of our depth. It is a chance for us to utilize that again."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/24/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-carolina-hurricanes-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Keefe on the encouraging takeaways from yesterday’s game:,"The attitude that we played with and the assertiveness, especially defensively with the way that we closed, the physicality, and the way that we protected our net. Over the last couple of months, all of those things have been on display. It takes a lot of work, commitment, discipline, and energy. Last night, we had all of that. You want to be able to duplicate that as best as you can. Certainly, the opponent tonight will demand that."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/24/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-carolina-hurricanes-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Keefe on whether there has been an added emphasis on physicality/assertiveness with the playoffs nearing:,"It has been an emphasis for us the entire season. There are a number of factors that go into doing it consistently: energy, discipline, commitment, and all of those types of things. Since the deadline has passed and we’ve brought in extra depth, Edmundson is going to bring that. Lyubushkin is going to bring that. Dewar is coming in on the forward end of things. These are guys who play hard, honest games. That just enhances it further. If you look at the others who have done it fairly consistently for us, on defense, in particular, it’s McCabe and Benoit. We think we have grown a lot in that area both in our personnel and our attitude."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/12/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-game-3-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the anticipation for the home opener:,"Excited. We want to take what we did in the first two games, with how we played the game and our process in the game, and bring it to the home ice, too. There is no reason to change that."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/12/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-game-3-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the possibility of a run-and-gun game of traded chances against the Penguins:,"We don’t want that. Our team has done a good job of that so far. Montreal and Jersey are quick transition teams — fast teams who wish to play on the move. We want to play our game. We don’t want to get into that back-and-forth type of game. We want to have a territorial game. It is going to be important against Pittsburgh to have that territorial, hang onto pucks, be strong on pucks, and take away their transition game. They are very good down low in the offensive at creating offense. We have to get back, get into good coverage, and make sure we are heavy around our net tonight."

I see a lot of good in all three zones with him. He is very responsible. Plus, he gets in on the forecheck and is strong on pucks creating opportunities that way for himself and his linemates. He has done a good job on the PK, too."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/12/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-game-3-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on his big guns going without a point through two games:,"Opportunities are there. They hit some posts. They’ve missed the net a little bit. It is not clean as much at times, but overall, I am happy with the effort. They are working and doing the right things. The scoring will come."

That is something we want to build off of, come out tonight, and play the same way. We want to clean up some areas we want to be better at, and keep doing what we were doing well. I think Craig is keeping us really honest. Everyone knows what to do. When you have that feeling in the group, I think everyone knows what to expect from everyone else."

I try to be respectful of their time and space. Certainly, we have had conversations already, and we will continue to have conversations at opportune times."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/12/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-game-3-projected-lines-tv-info/,Sullivan on how Michael Bunting has settled into the Penguins lineup:,"Bunts has been a real good player for us since we got him. He seems to have fit into our lineup really well. He has played a lot with Geno. We think he has played extremely well there. He drags people into the fight, so to speak, and I think that is an aspect of his game that has really helped our team."

I have seen this over the years. We all have. One of your best players is out of the lineup, so everybody elevates their role a little bit. Everybody gets a little bit more of a different role at times. They did a good job. They did what we had to do. It is going to be the same tonight."

I was fine with it. It was a little demoralizing, though. He is an incredible player. One of those guys who everyone idolizes in how he plays. Special player."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-game-15-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Rielly on the team’s 36-19-2 record without Matthews:,"It makes me feel a little bit better. I know the record is pretty good when I am out of the lineup, too. I think it is just a matter of guys trying to take on more responsibility. You realize you are at a loss without him. Guys have to step up and pull more weight. The goal will always be to have that mentality when everyone is healthy and playing, but when you lose an important player like him, you need more out of everyone. When you are able to achieve that and come together as a team, guys take on more responsibility and play well. We were lucky enough to get a result we liked last time out. We will see if we can do it again."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-game-15-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Rielly on the team’s power-play success without Matthews and the difference without him on the man advantage:,"I don’t think it changes anything, but you don’t have your top guy, so you have to step up. Everyone has to be a bit more “on.” You want to be able to achieve that when everyone is in and have the high level of execution — and we have had that times without everyone in — but with him out, guys have to step up. Do you change your plan? A little bit, because he is kind of the focus of it, but I don’t think that is a reflection of the results. It is just a different mentality."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-game-15-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Chris Tanev on the team’s winning performance vs. Boston without Matthews:,"It is just about playing a team game and playing how we want to play — smart, simple, hard. As a team, that is what we have been growing toward as the season has gone on. We have had some really good games and a couple of games we haven’t liked, but for the most part, we have grown as a team. We saw that the other night against Boston. It is up to us to duplicate that effort."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-game-15-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Rielly on the reasons for his successful partnership with OEL:,"I don’t know, but I have really enjoyed playing with him. Early on, when we played a bit together over the course of a game when were down, it worked well. It was easy chemistry. He is an extremely talented player. He has played for a long time. He has that experience as well. He is an easy guy to jump in with. I have enjoyed it a lot. He is a great puck mover and a great skater. He is tough defensively. I think it has been a lot of fun. Our goal is to continue to work together and build our game to ultimately help the team, but for the two of us, it has been really fun."

It was the shutout of the Boston Bruins. They are probably similar to us. They have an emphasis on keeping the puck out of the net. They look really good. It’s going to be a really hard challenge for us tonight.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-game-15-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Lalonde on whether the opposition lets their guard down when Matthews is out of the lineup:,There is probably a little more comfort not seeing him because it is a guaranteed tough night. He is going to create offense and usually find the back of the net. It is probably more of a credit to their group. Everybody is giving a little bit more urgency in their game more than the opposition letting up.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-game-15-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Lalonde on re-inserting Justin Holl into the lineup in place of Jeff Petry:,"It’s probably more about using everyone amidst a three-in-four with travel. Justin has played very well for us this year. We were kind of giving the younger D an opportunity, and then our D core played well. It is more about getting Justin back in because he had been playing well for us."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/30/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-buffalo-sabres-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Bobby McMann on the chemistry and fit alongside John Tavares and William Nylander so far:,"They are elite players, and it is a little different playing with them. You never know when you are going to get the puck or what they are going to do with it. You always have to be ready. I think it has been good so far. I think they just demand high execution all the time. They expect you to make plays. That is the type of game I want to play. It is pushing me to be a better player and to get them the puck and vice versa. I think we are all good enough to make plays."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/30/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-buffalo-sabres-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,McMann on the challenge of shutting down Tage Thompson coming off of his four-goal game vs. New Jersey last night:,"Just get in his space. If you make him rush plays, he is not going to have the puck on his stick. Be aware of him, but with the way that we pressure, we have been playing hard and physically lately. If we’re playing through his hands, I think it shouldn’t be a problem."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/30/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-buffalo-sabres-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,McMann on the pros and cons of playing against a tired opponent in the second half of a back-to-back:,"You could maybe say they are a little slower, but there are also times when they are right in the game, maybe before we are. On the back-to-back, for us, sometimes it feels like you are in the game and have your reads and spacing clicking right away because you were just playing the night before. We definitely aren’t taking it lightly. We have to be ready for them."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/30/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-buffalo-sabres-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Sheldon Keefe on the challenge the Sabres present:,"The opponent tonight is probably more like New Jersey and less like Washington. That in and of itself creates different challenges in terms of their skill set, ability to play in transition, and the pace they can bring from the defense. We are going to be challenged in different ways than we were the other night. We are going to have to be that much more focused on it and be good on offense ourselves while making sure we are managing the puck really well. Play in the offensive zone and make it harder on their top people by forcing them to defend."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/30/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-buffalo-sabres-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Keefe on whether he reminded his team of the 9-3 loss to Buffalo in December:,"I mentioned it yesterday. That is a long time ago and a lot has changed since then, but it is a reminder of what this opponent is capable of and the type of skill that they have when you don’t play an organized game. You open up the possibility of something like that happening. It was just a reminder of that. I don’t think we need to go too far into it. It is more about using it as an example of the chances we gave up and the type of game we played there. We gave up free offense. In those kinds of games, this team thrives."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-40-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,"TheLeafsare hoping that now, as the top six returns to its most familiar, full-strength setup (Knies – Matthews – Marner / Pacioretty – Tavares – Nylander), they are going to find their most complete, deep, and dangerous offensive form of the season entering the new year, to go along with their generally steady defense and high-level goaltending.","This is as good as the Leafs forward group gets right now – which is really, really good – no notes.

You are talking about one of the premiere goal-scorers in the league. We have to make some adjustments accordingly. It gives them more depth up front. We have to make sure our matchups are pretty tight tonight as best as we can on the road. We have seen a lot of Matthews. We know what he can bring to their team."

I had the opportunity to come back as a player and play in the old Maple Leaf Gardens and see the transformation with the new building. It is a great hockey city. Always has been. Always will be."

We have played them in the playoffs I don’t know how many times over the last six or seven years. It is always a good matchup against Toronto. Nothing has changed.

There was actually a lot of discussion about it — where does he go, and what do we do? More than anything, I just like the look of that line together. They have played extremely well this year for us. Tavares, Pacioretty, and Nylander have played well for us. The Domi line is playing well together. We just had to make a couple of lineup decisions with Reaves and Holmberg."

He is a unique, special player who does so much for us at all ends of the ice. No one can score goals quite like him. We are thrilled. It has been up and down for him and has been frustrating at times, but he has just continued to stay with what he has to do to work through it and get himself ready to play. I know he is excited."

I think it fits well into the system, just playing hard and fast and moving pucks up. It has been a good fit so far. It is pretty simple for me. I just have to move the puck fast. We want to play fast. I have put a lot of work into my defensive game, and I think it has become a strong suit of mine. I am just looking to continue to build on that."

A couple of tough scenarios, but it’s not bad. I definitely have a lot to improve on tonight in the little areas of the game, like holding onto pucks.

I am a buddy of Tie’s, so he is in my head a lot. I have called Max Tie a few times. Max is a really good passer. We all know that. Willy can score goals and shoot. You have Johnny T there in the middle. Really, we have a few guys on the line who can take faceoffs and play down low, which is great. Just watching Willy out there on draws, he is good on the faceoff circle, which is important. I feel it is a good combination. A lot of speed on the wings, and a lot of work by #91 in the middle of the ice, especially around the net. He is good there, scores goals there, and wins battles there. I feel it could be a good line that has speed on the wings, playmaking ability, and shooting."

I knew Robertson was skilled, fast, and could shoot, but what surprised me about his work in camp so far is that his work ethic and competitiveness have been excellent. To me, that is what is going to make him a really good player in this league. His shooting skill and skating will take over, but it is the competitiveness and winning of the battles that he’s done."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/05/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-preseason-game-6-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on Pacioretty’s contributions in camp:,"He is experienced for sure. A big guy who is strong on pucks. In the last game, he did a great job down low on some plays and drew a few penalties because he was strong on pucks and winning battles on the wall. He has the ability to score goals. He has scored a lot of goals in this league with his shot, but I think he can be a really good player winning battles on the wall and hanging onto pucks in the offensive zone. That is how we want to play. We want to have o-zone time, hang onto pucks, and wear teams down. He can do those things for us."

I am feeling good just skating around in the practice, getting the timing back down pat, and playing with all sorts of different players. You don’t know who your linemate is going to be at camp.

I went back and looked at them all. They are independent stories of one another. We are a different team than we were last year, so I would say that’s point number one. With the coaching change, there are some things that they do differently as a team that we have to be aware of. What went on last year… I would love to get a win against a team that I was a part of for a couple of years, but as far as the preparation and what we do, I think it is independent of theLeafs."

We got scored on in the first shift off of a turnover. We didn’t play the rush very well. We have to have a better start, for sure. We didn’t really recover from that start, in my opinion. They carried play until the third period. For me, we got outskated in the game. Their compete level was higher than ours. That caused most of the problems. From a tactical standpoint, when you are getting outskated and outcompeted, it causes a lot of problems in your system."

They have scored a lot off the rush this year. We have to do a good job off the rush coming out of their zone. Their D are very active. Their power play is going well, too, so they are dangerous in that aspect. They are scoring goals. We have to be tight-checking. We can’t be giving up odd-man rushes tonight.

The ticky-tack and bantam stuff — like getting squirted with the water bottle when we’re on the ice — doesn’t make me love them anymore. It’s nice to make it sting the most with a goal on the other 5-on-3. … We were opportunistic on the special teams, snapping it around, and I thought we were really good there.” – Alex Steeves on theMarlies‘ efficient power play and his dislike of the Laval Rocket “I thought we had a really good first period. We were connected. We knew we had to move pucks quickly out of our end because they’re a high-pressure team. We were winning our battles along the wall. It’s a great win for us. We’ll take it.” – John Gruden"

I didn’t think we generated enough offensively or got to our game tonight with our forecheck and our hard play down low in the offensive zone. It was in and out too quickly. We spent too much time in our own end. The penalty killing was really good. The goaltending was really good. I thought our D battled hard back there. We didn’t do enough with the puck. We did a lot of good things defensively tonight. We blocked shots, and our sticks were good. We kept a lot of their shots on the outside, in my opinion, but we have to get up ice and play. We have to get our forecheck going. It is a big part of our game and has been all year. It just wasn’t there tonight."

There wasn’t anything going on with that unit. The other unit has done a good job for us. We just wanted to make a switch to put Mitch down low by the net to make some plays from below the goal line. We really didn’t get set up. We have to work harder on our power play. In my opinion, we are not competing hard enough. We are not digging in. On the power play, it is not just about making plays. You have to do other things, too, to make it successful. Right now, we have to dig in a lot more on our PP."

They battled hard. We talked about getting pucks going north from our zone. They rimmed a lot of pucks — I get it — but that is what we asked them to do. They defended the front of our net pretty well. For me, they were pretty solid. Without Tanev, our PK did a good job. I was pleased with our defense."

He has been put into a role now where he is one of our starters and is playing a lot of games. He did a good job in Florida when he played and won a lot of games there. For me, I didn’t have a ton of expectations on either of our goalies, but they have both played extremely well."

We are 0-2 against these guys this year. For us, it is one of those games that says, “Where are we at?” If we go down 0-3 to Toronto, to me, it is not where we want to be. We are starting a four-game road trip. We have two back-to-backs. I’d be really disappointed if we don’t come out strong here."

In the one in Tampa, it didn’t feel good being down 4-0, and it was kind of the same when we were in here. I don’t think we really gave ourselves a chance. In Tampa, we closed the gap, but 4-0 is 4-0. Our starts have to be better."

Because they get it. If they aren’t held accountable, who is going to be? It is not the actual player who feels it at times. It is the rest of the team. You are coaching the team, not just one player. In saying that, do coaches love doing it? No. It is not something you get joy out of. You want to make sure everything goes smoothly for 82 games, but we’ve all been around long enough to know it is not going to happen. No fun to do it, but ultimately, your job is to put yourself in the best position to win both physically and mentally. Sometimes, it has to happen."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-game-48-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Cooper on the Atlantic Division race:,"There used to be a top four and another four. That is how it was for a long time. That is clearly not the case anymore. In playing the teams in our division, the gap has closed. Whether Toronto or Florida are the class of the division right now, they are not a class above everybody else in this division, whereas in years past, I think that used to be the case. It is a coin flip right now."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-game-48-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Jake McCabe on the adjustment to the right side:,"It is just a little bit more skating, making sure I know what is coming behind me when I get the puck, making good puck decisions, and communicating between Mo and me. It is nothing too crazy. I have played enough on the right side now, but that is what I tell myself: scan the ice a bit more before I get the puck."

I am excited to play together, have good communication, break up pucks, and get going the other way."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-game-48-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,McCabe on the challenge of shutting down Nikita Kucherov:,"The catchphrase is to take away time and space, which is important, but for a guy like him, he seems like he always knows where his options are. You have to be aware, before you go to take away his time and space and leave the middle of the ice, that you have it covered off, whether it is a centerman sitting there waiting for a pop play or he can make plays on his backhand or forehand off the wall. You have to be aware of what is away from him that he is looking to set up."

This is a competitive team. They win a lot of battles — a lot of puck battles — and that sticks out to me more than anything. I get that they have high-end players and can make plays, but it is the battle level and the effort that they put in every shift that stand out to me."

They like playing together. McCabe played on the right side last year quite a bit here in Toronto. We are going to try him with Morgan. Morgan has had a lot of partners this year. It is not his fault or anybody’s fault. It is how things go with injuries and finding the right shot to play over there. McCabe has experience. He is a very good player and defender. That is what we are looking for tonight."

It is a good mixture of younger and older talent. With Seider and Edvinsson, they have some big defensemen. They’re a good team with a lot of players who have a lot of skill. That is the way I look at it. Dangerous."

He is a big guy who is a very physical player. He does a great job of getting up the ice with the play and doing his thing in the zone with his shot and his ability to move. He is a hard guy to defend and a hard guy to beat in the offensive zone because of his size, stick length, and skating ability. Very good player."

We look at other metrics, too. We have had a lot of opportunities. I don’t know where we are ranked right now, but it wasn’t long ago that we were ranked pretty high in the league as far as shooting pucks from very good areas and creating grade-As. We have to keep doing it. They don’t go in all the time, but we have to stay with it and find a way to produce a little bit more that way. It is not from a lack of generating looks. I think we are getting good looks and doing some real good things, but we just haven’t scored. It is like our five-on-five scoring, too, a little bit. We get looks, and we have to find a way to get some more goals. As long as we are getting the looks… Yes, we have to finish better, but we are getting looks."

We have been moving the puck on the outside a little too much and haven’t had chances around the net. That is what we are trying to focus on: getting it down there and creating loose pucks. That is what we are looking to do with these new units. It is going to be important for us to get the puck around the net.

It has been an interesting team to watch back in that they haven’t been the offensive juggernaut they have been in the past. Obviously, they have high-end guys. We can’t give their top-end guys easy ice and easy looks. That will be the challenge. This is a really good team. I didn’t mind our game in Toronto last time out. We limited some offense from them, but we got checked pretty well, too. It is on us to stay within our game. In the last game, we did not for the last 10 minutes of the second period."

You see a guy who wants to produce every night and is not satisfied with where he is in his game. He knows how good he is as well. When Stamkos and Ovechkin hit 60, it seemed like a big number. 70 seemed out of reach for anyone. Even this year, it didn’t seem like a realistic number, but here we are. He is right there. He’s had five or six hat tricks as well, so that adds up. It’s off the charts. It is incredible. … There is a lot of talk about his shot and his release, but a lot of his goals are scored around the net, too, right in the crease. He can score any way. He scores pretty goals, dirty goals, one-timers, wrist shots, and snap shots by changing his release angle."

Over 200 feet in that game, we did a pretty good job of it. We are going to need the same type of effort tonight. They don’t need a whole lot to create offense. If we give them anything easy, it will be a long night for us."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/13/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Morgan Rielly on Timothy Liljegren’s return to the lineup:,"Prior to his injury, I thought he was playing outstanding. You can tell with him when he is making plays, skating, and has that confidence about him. He is extremely dangerous. He has grown a lot. When he is on top of his game, he is a great player for us."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/13/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Rielly on the team’s goals in the final three games:,"You want to tighten everything up. You want to tighten up your special teams, your breakouts, and your gaps as D. You want to be feeling good. You have to do what you have to do as an individual to get your game in a place where you feel good. As a team, you want to make sure everything is dialed with the special teams and everything that comes down to structure and team mentality."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/13/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Nick Robertson on the challenge against the Red Wings tonight:,"A playoff-style game. Detroit is fighting for a playoff spot. It is good for us to get that mentality right away in a playoff game. Hopefully, we can get a win in our last regular-season home game."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/13/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Lalonde on James Reimer’s 500-game milestone:,"These milestones are impressive. 80th goalie to reach 500 games, and the way he did it with compete, hard work… It is fitting he is doing it here in Toronto in a meaningful game for our organization. Every night he is in there, you know he is going to give it his all. Battling-type of saves. He motivates us. He elevates our group when he is battling in there. Both goalies have given us a ton. We are without our number-one goalie for most of the season. Both of these goalies have been thrust into an elevated role. They’ve been great. They’re the reason why we’re still in this battle."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/13/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Sheldon Keefe on the buzz around Matthews’ chase for 70:,"I get more of a thrill just watching Auston play and where his game is at. Wherever the number gets to, I am not concerned about it and have never been concerned about it. I am not even convinced he is concerned about it. Where it sits right now is a pretty tremendous accomplishment. We will see what the rest of the season brings starting tonight, but the most important thing for me is that his game is in good order. He has developed tremendous chemistry with Max and Bert. It has given us so many more options as a result. That is what has really come out of this for me."

https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-10-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,CraigBerube on mixing up the power-play units:,"We’ve been thinking about it a little bit, and we’re just going to do it tonight. It’s all about results, for the most part, and we’re not getting them. We’ve got to try something different and a little bit more direct. This should make it a little bit more direct on the power play. It’s about getting more action at the net. We need to get more action at the net — good net front, strong guys at the net who can win puck battles around there, and things like that. That’s what we’re looking for with these units."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-10-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on helping William Nylander get back on track after three games without a point:,"We’re talking to him for sure and trying to find something that’s going to work with him. If he doesn’t get the puck enough, it’s hard. He’s a guy that needs the puck in his hands. We’ve got to try to find a way to get the puck into his hands a little bit more in areas where he can expose the opposition. That’s part of the coaching end with Willy. It’s just communicating with him, what he’s seeing, and trying to help him."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-10-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on re-uniting Nylander with John Tavares:,"They’ve been successful (together) in the past. With Pacioretty there, it’s a big winger who can score. We’re trying to find a little bit more scoring in some other lines."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-10-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on making Nick Robertson a healthy scratch:,"He’s been fine. I think Nicky has worked extremely hard. He obviously hasn’t had much puck luck, just missing shots and things like that, but he’s done a lot of good things. With Winnipeg tonight, it’s a pretty big team. You wanted some size in the lineup."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-10-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Jets head coach Scott Arniel on his team’s ability to find ways to win all eight games so far:,"Everybody is still in the race. At this time of year, everyone still thinks they are in the playoffs. You are not getting easy games. You have to go take it from teams. All of these games have been really competitive. I like the fact that whether it is the first shift or the last shift, we are going as hard as we possibly need to go and sticking by how we need to play. We have a style, a system, and standards we need to stick to. It has more to do with us playing our game on a consistent basis."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-10-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,London native Dylan DeMelo on the extra juice for games against Toronto:,"It was probably more special when I first came into the league, being from London close by. I know a whole lot of Leafs fans back home. It has a little extra feel to it. You know everyone is going to be watching back home, but it was moreso when I was first playing in the league. I will say it is always fun playing these guys. They travel well with their fans. It is always a good building with our fans. It is going to be a good one tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-winnipeg-jets-game-10-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,DeMelo on the Jets’ five straight losses to Toronto:,"The last few times we have played these guys, we have gotten away from our game. We got into a track meet. That is not our game. We know they have a different philosophy with Berube, and they’te trying to play a different way, but at the end of the day, it is all about us and how we play. We have a good thing going right now. We want to keep it going."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-1-preview-projected-lineups-tv-broadcast-info/,Sheldon Keefe on the importance of getting to the inside against a stingy Bruins team:,"We have to work for it. We have to stay with it. We have to stay patient. It is just about work. Whether it is this team or any other, it is the time of year. It is what is required. It is a big emphasis. We have done a good job of getting to the inside. We have scored a lot of goals from that space all season long. This is one of the teams that makes it the hardest. The time of the year itself makes it a little difficult. That is the goal for both teams: try to get to each other’s net."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-1-preview-projected-lineups-tv-broadcast-info/,Jim Montgomery on his approach to matchups in Game 1:,"You kind of start out with matchups in your head, but I am a big possession coach. A lot of times, faceoffs matter — where they are, who they are — so that we can start with the puck."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-1-preview-projected-lineups-tv-broadcast-info/,Montgomery on whether he has a Plan B in mind for his lines if the game doesn’t start favourably:,"Most of it is feel. You can go in with a plan in mind, but if this guy is going or that guy is not going… You have to know who is going to put them in a situation. If you are going to move a guy up to play with Pasta and Zacha or Coyle and Marchand, they have to be going. They have to be able to handle it mentally playing with those guys. There are not that many guys you are going to move around, but there are a few guys I have in mind that I know I can move around, and it doesn’t affect their game. Usually, they give momentum to whatever line they go to."

The tough guys start making plays. Everyone raises their game to the next level. That is what makes it so fun being out there playing.

For me coming in three-quarters of the way through the year, they have made me feel really welcome. It is a great locker room. Everyone is really tight. You never know when you have the guys making the big money and if they might do their own thing, but no. It is definitely a family in this dressing room. It is nice to see. We are hanging out in the hotel lounge or going to dinners together. It is cool."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-1-preview-projected-lineups-tv-broadcast-info/,Nick Robertson on the meaning of playing his first NHL playoff game in front of fans:,"It is everything. When you are a kid, you want to play in these environments. To be with the Leafs and play Boston in the first game, there is nothing better than that."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-1-preview-projected-lineups-tv-broadcast-info/,John Tavares on the team’s power play entering the playoffs:,We started getting things trending in the right direction. There is a lot of continuity within the group over our time together. It is just sticking with that and not getting caught up too much in how the last few months went. There were a lot of guys in and out at times. We just have to stay with it. Guy [Boucher] has done a great job of preparing us throughout the season and the ebbs and flows you go through. Things have been trending well for us over the last few games.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/11/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vancouver-canucks-game-44-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Max Pacioretty on whether the team can use Canucks’ schedule and travel situation to their advantage:,"I didn’t know [the Canucks were flying in today]. It is not something we would even talk about or care about. Professionals. Whether it is something known or private, everyone kind of deals with their things. I expect them to come out really hard for a Canadian matchup."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/11/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vancouver-canucks-game-44-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Pacioretty on the mindset coming off a healthy scratch in Carolina:,"Just keep going. I like where I am at. As a team, we would like to be playing better. There were a lot of wins in there, but we weren’t too thrilled about the process every night when it came to those wins. That doesn’t mean that you sit here and nitpick. Just keep building my game. Good opportunity tonight. Hopefully, I can keep building my game."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/11/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vancouver-canucks-game-44-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Pacioretty on the importance of winning the division:,"It is a little bit too early for that. Especially in the East, there are a lot of teams jammed up there. It is definitely, in my mind, too early to look at that. Maybe a little bit more by the break. Trying to pick up points every night is the most important thing, and then you see where it lays out after that. Teams get hot and cold at the right and wrong times. We just went on a little bit of a heater in the standings, but we do think we have a lot in our game to get better at. That is where the focus is, first and foremost."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/11/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vancouver-canucks-game-44-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Chris Tanev on the Canucks traveling to Toronto from Raleigh on the day of the game:,"It happened last year when I was in Dallas. I don’t know where we were, but we flew the day of to Colorado. We ended up playing really well, so sometimes, you just show up and don’t think. You’re playing. But it is not ideal to travel on the day of the game. Everyone has their routines and everything. It can throw it for a loop."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/11/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vancouver-canucks-game-44-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Rick Tocchet on his team’s league-low shots on goal rate:,"There are opportunities to hit the net and shoot. There is no magic tic-tac-toe stuff. We have to try to generate some stuff, but we need people to move their feet, too."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/11/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vancouver-canucks-game-44-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on coaching against a Rick Tocchet-coached team:,"He is a very good and smart coach. He is a guy who, matchup-wise, will do some different things. You have to be ready for it. He is not just going to match head-to-head with the top players all the time. He is going to throw other players against your top guys and try to mix it up and get his guys loose against other lines. He is a very good coach. He has done a lot of great things in the league."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/11/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vancouver-canucks-game-44-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on how the team can take advantage of a tired Canucks team that traveled from Raleigh the day of the game:,"Well, you just kind of focus on us and our team. I get it. It’s tough travel for them after playing last night. I get all that, but let’s just throw that all out the window. Let’s focus on us. We are going to focus on what we need to do better from the last game. Check. Play defense. Keep the puck out of our net. We didn’t do a good enough job of it last game. We had played of chances to score, and we scored goals. But we gave up too much in the game."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/11/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vancouver-canucks-game-44-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the decision to start Dennis Hildeby for tonight’s game:,"Woll has played a lot, and I was thinking ahead to Dallas coming in. I liked Dennis’ game in his last start. There was the mentor’s trip, travel, and travel home. That is why I went with Hildeby."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-game-16-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Canadiens head coach Martin St. Louis on his team’s recent defensive play despite the recent losses:,"I am happy since we made some corrections. I am happy with the way we are defending. I feel like we have had to defend less, which is a good sign. I think we are killing plays earlier and we are not giving the opponent an opportunity to set up their offensive zone. It starts with the way we arrive and the way we understand what triggers the o-zone. It’s been good."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-game-16-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,St. Louis on what’s required to snap the five-game losing slump:,It all starts with effort. We are a team that can’t not be desperate every night. I feel we are more consistent in that department. I expect that tonight.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-game-16-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the challenge the Canadiens will present tonight:,"They are going to play hard. They are always big games with Montreal-Toronto. I expect a team with a bunch of guys who are really talented and can skate. They play a fast game. We have to be on our toes defending and checking. They are going to be a desperate team tonight. We have to match the desperation, and make sure we are playing to our identity and are not opening things up. We have to do our job as our team and check, play smart with the puck, and be patient."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-game-16-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the keys to generating more five-on-five offense after three games without a five-on-five goal:,"Overall, I think we have generated quite a few offensive chances. The last few games have been low-event games, in my opinion, both ways. In the offensive zone, I think we can do a better job of hanging onto pucks a little bit better and using low-to-high a little bit more with our D to get shots to the net and create a little bit more chaos around the net. Then, we can try to create a little bit more movement in the offensive zone. That is what I see right now."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-game-16-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Bobby McMann on the success of his line with Pontus Holmberg and Nick Robertson against the Red Wings on Friday night:,"I think we were heavy on pucks, hard on the forecheck, and consistent with our effort. We were trying to get pucks back, get sticks in lanes, and turn over pucks to go the other way. We had success doing that, and we got a few chances."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-game-16-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,"McMann on his and Robertson’s nine- and six-game scoring slumps, respectively:","We have both been together long enough that we realize there is a lot of talent between us. It comes in waves. Sometimes, it is not what is hitting the back of the net. It is the chances that you are getting. That is what we are focusing on. We are trying to pick each other up when we are generating chances and making good plays while also being good defensively. I think [defense] comes first."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/30/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-5-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Sheldon Keefe on the team’s mindset coming off a disappointing Game 4 loss:,"You definitely felt the disappointment, but it was important we got right back to it the next day, bringing the guys in and talking through the situation. There is still tremendous belief amongst the group. We also know what the challenge is. That is why you try to focus on tonight and preparing for tonight. You go out and give everything you have to earn another game on the schedule."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/30/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-5-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on whether frustration is building around the various health situations:,"It is part of the job. A lot of teams — frankly, all teams — go through it. You are hoping that when playoffs come around, you will be at full capacity. That is not always the case. It started for us with Bobby McMann. But teams deal with different things that come up. We have won one game in this series already in Game 2 without Willy and Bobby. No matter what the situation is… Boston had an injury on defense, made some changes on defense, and got better in the series as a result. Things happen, and good teams respond well to those situations. And we have all season."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/30/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-5-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on Joseph Woll’s readiness to enter the series:,"He has stayed with his regular routines. He is a very regimented guy. He is very detailed in handling and taking care of himself. He maximizes his practice reps. He has been outstanding in the practices we’ve had since preparing for the playoffs. He has really looked at those as his games. To me, he has been really, really good there. He is ready for an opportunity to come in."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/30/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-5-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on whether the Bruins forfeiting a 3-1 series lead to Florida last spring serves as inspiration:,"Nothing to do with Boston specifically, but it is a fresh reminder that these things happen. Teams do come back. We have been on the other side of one. These things happen and are possible. They are not possible if you don’t start with one. That is where we are at tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/30/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-5-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Ryan Reaves on the need to channel the right emotions in a 3-1 series hole:,"You have to get excited for these ones. Until the series is over, it’s not over. This team gave up a lead in the same 3-1 situation last year. Sports are a crazy thing. We have all seen some crazy comebacks in our lives. I have been a part of a few. We are just excited to start it up today."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/30/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-5-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Reaves on the mentality required to stage a 3-1 series comeback:,"Not looking at the 3-1. If you dwell on it too much, it creeps into your mind. You just have to take it game by game. You have to look at what you have done in the regular season. You have put three games together before, right? It is not out of the realm to do it again."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/30/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-5-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Jake McCabe on whether Florida’s 3-1 comeback vs. Boston is a source of inspiration:,It has definitely been brought up. We are trying to put pressure on their group over there. They are sitting comfy at 3-1. We want to put pressure on that. It starts with a win tonight.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/30/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-5-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Jim Montgomery on weighing up whether to make changes to a winning lineup as players — such a Derek Forbort — become healthy:,"You don’t want to change things just to change things, but if you think your team can get better because of matchups or history with players and where you think they might be utilized to help the Bruins, that is when you look at potentially making changes."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/30/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-5-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Montgomery on the points of emphasis heading into Game 5:,I want to see us start on time.

https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/30/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-5-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Jake DeBrusk on whether last year’s series defeat to Florida provided a lesson the Bruins can apply to the current 3-1 lead vs. Toronto:,"Every playoff series is different, and every year is different… It is something that ended our season last year, and we don’t want it to happen again. We have put ourselves in a good position. The fourth one is the hardest one to win. That’s what everyone always says, and it is true. We have to be at our best to match their intensity."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/05/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-14-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Jim Montgomery on David Pastrnak’s response to a third-period benching vs. Seattle:,"He was incredible. Very vocal picking up players. In the last 15 seconds, he was talking about what a great team win it is. I have said this numerous times: I am really lucky to work with the leaders I get to work with. I am very fortunate. In other places, you have seen coaches where it is a big problem. I am lucky with the accountability that exists in this culture and the leaders I get to deal with. It allows me to hold everybody accountable."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/05/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-14-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Montgomery on dealing with the outside noise and calls for his dismissal:,"The way I deal with it… There is a great poem called “Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow.” It is a lot of what I believe in the process of our team. You only control the present. If you worry about the past and dwell on the past, it brings up anxiety, worry, or contentment, depending on what you are thinking about. If you worry about the future, which you don’t control, then you are really going to have anxiety. That is where my mindset goes. With the struggles I have had personally, that poem really reinforced what I need to worry about, which is the next 24 hours. That is the way I live my life."

You take responsibility for needing to be better, but at the same time, I am just moving forward. I am focusing on the game [tonight]. Yesterday was yesterday. I never look back. It was a bad turnover. I take responsibility for it — or accountability is the better word. I just want to move forward. I don’t want to be a distraction to the team. The guys know how I feel about them in here. It was a bad play. I take accountability. Already moving forward."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/05/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-14-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the major challenge the Bruins have consistently provided over recent years:,"The personnel has changed some, but their culture, how they play the game, and what they value in the game has not changed. They have solid goaltending. They have a big D corps that defends well. Their forwards are solid defensively. They don’t give you much. You have to earn what you get against them. At the same time, you have to make sure we are not cheating and forcing it too much. We have to play patient against them. It is going to be a key point tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/05/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-14-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on Max Domi elevating onto the Marner-Knies line in Auston Matthews’ absence:,"Max has been in this situation before here. I wasn’t here, but I watched it. Max has been around for a long time. He is a good player and the type of player that relishes that kind of thing. He understands what his job is tonight and what he needs to do. He just goes out and executes."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/05/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-14-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the reasons for theLeafs‘ success without Matthews in the past:,"I think everyone just digs in more. Different players get different opportunities in situations like this, whether it is more minutes or maybe they are on the power play. They elevate their game. Everybody needs to elevate their game tonight not just because Auston is out of the lineup but because we are playing the Bruins. It is going to be a good, hard game. We need everyone on board tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/05/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-14-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the decision to start Anthony Stolarz in goal:,"It is always a discussion with the goalies and where we are at in the schedule. We have a back-to-back coming up after tonight. I liked his game last time, so I chose to go with him tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/05/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-14-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Montgomery on the recent history against the Leafs:,"Every time we play each other, they are great games. They are one-goal games, or there is an empty-netter. I know we have gotten great goaltending. It seems like they are 2-1 or 3-1 games, so they are getting good goaltending. It is physical and honest hockey."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/05/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-14-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,"Montgomery on adjustments on the penalty kill if the Leafs run a five-forward PP unit, and whether more pressure needs to be applied to the PPQB up top:","Really, you can’t get out of your structure penalty killing just because there are five forwards, but you do have to expect them to be attacking seams from up top, not only down low. It really depends on who it is up top. If it is a guy like Marner, who doesn’t shoot very much, you maybe stay off of him, so you are tighter to the next pass. If it is Matthews, you probably want to get out in that shot lane."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/02/29/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-arizona-coyotes-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,"Especially with the Red Wings refusing to go away in the playoff race and nipping at Toronto’s heels in the divisional playoff race, these are two points theLeafsneed to take care of, and this is a statistic the Leafs should absolutely put an end to tonight:","Wanna read a stat that is so wild it doesn't even seem true? The Maple Leafs haven't gotten a home regulation win against the Coyotes since Oct 17, 2002. Trevor Kidd was in the net.#LeafsForever — MICHAEL DISTEFANO (@mickey_canuck)February 29, 2024"
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/02/29/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-arizona-coyotes-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Max Domi on Sheldon Keefe getting kicked out of the last game by the officials:,"He wants to win just as much as any guy in this room does. He has been driving the ship for this group for the last few years and has done a good job. He has our back and we have his back. As a group, we love seeing him get fired up like that and bring some emotion. We started out great and didn’t finish the way we wanted it to, but Keefer was upset with what was going on, and he had every right to be. We have his back just like he does for us. I loved it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/02/29/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-arizona-coyotes-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Domi on the standout attributes of Keefe compared to his many previous coaches in the NHL:,"I have been really lucky, man. I have had some great coaches — Rick Tocchet, Dave Tippett, and Rod Brind’Amour were unbelievable. Luke Richardson might be one of the best human beings in the game of hockey, and obviously, I had Pete DeBoer as well. That was great. Now I get Keefer, who is younger compared to those guys, but it seems like he has been around for a long, long time. I played against him in junior. The one thing that stands out with a guy like Sheldon is that his attention to detail is second to none. He doesn’t miss much. He loves things done a certain way. Until you execute it that way consistently, he is going to keep showing it and trying to drag you that way. That is what you want from a coach. He sets the bar higher and higher every single day. Everyone in here enjoys playing for him. I enjoy playing for him. It has been great."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/02/29/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-arizona-coyotes-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Domi on where his line with Tyler Bertuzzi and William Nylander can improve defensively to support its offensive contributions:,"I think the best defense is playing good offense, so we’ll keep with that and clean up a few things — maybe a little more communication coming back to our own zone. All three of us can skate and put a lot of back pressure on the opponent. It limits the time they spend in our zone. Closing quickly means we aren’t spending time in our own zone and getting gassed. There are a few things we can clean up, but I think we are heading in the right direction."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/02/29/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-arizona-coyotes-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Domi on singing happy birthday to Tyler Bertuzzi on Instagram over the weekend:,"Bert and I are so close now. It is one of those things where he hates attention. I just wanted to spotlight him a little bit there. He had such a big day. It was his birthday. Most guys didn’t know it was his birthday until closer to the game because he is not that guy. He doesn’t want that kind of attention, which I respect so much. He is super low-key — just a normal, humble dude. Singing happy birthday on the tarmac on the way to the plane was something where he was in it and he couldn’t shy away from the camera. We had some fun with it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/02/29/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-arizona-coyotes-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Auston Matthews on former teammate Alex Kerfoot:,"He is a great, great guy. He was a very popular guy on our team since he got traded. We all love him a lot. It sucks to see guys go, but it is part of the game. He is a great person and someone we all look forward to chatting with after the game. He has been playing really well for them. We are all very happy for him. It’ll be fun to go against him. He can play anywhere in the lineup. Such a smart player. He has speed. You can put him in any situation you need him to play in. The great thing about him is that he was very open to doing that. There was never a bad day for him whether it was on the fourth line, the first line, or somewhere in between. It didn’t really matter to him. He was always going to give his best effort and do what he could to help the team win."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/02/29/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-arizona-coyotes-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Sheldon Keefe on keeping Morgan Rielly-TJ Brodie together during Timothy Liljegren’s absence:,"You talk through all of the different options that we have. We have six lefties again tonight. We are in a jam right now with Liljegren being out and we can put Timmins in that category as a right shot. Having righties lets things fall into place. When you have the lefties, it jams things up. You look at Brodie’s situation. To me, he played better on the left side of late, but we are in a jam right now. We talked through all of the different options. When you are in a jam like this, you have to fall on what has worked for you over time. [Rielly-Brodie] is not going the best right now, but it has worked well for us. Benoit-McCabe has worked really well for us. Splitting that up, I don’t know if it really helps our cause. Brodie has been better on the left, but he has played more on the right than anybody on our team. When we have no righties in a jam like this, we have to trust and give these guys a chance to go out and play. That is really it. We will monitor it as we go. To help ourselves through this, the guys have to clear their heads, go out, play, and trust themselves. Lagesson has done a good job on the right side for us. McCabe has done a good job on the right side for us. Brodie has done a better job on his offside than anybody in the entire league over the course of his career. At a time when we are in a jam, I think it is important that we trust the guys to go out and get us through this. At the same time, as always, when we have players out of our lineup, the forwards have to really help. We just have to get connected. We have done a good job of it. We have had two pairs of all lefties for quite some time now. We managed it just fine. Let’s not make it a bigger deal than we need to."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/02/29/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-arizona-coyotes-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Keefe on the excitement about Joseph Woll’s return to the crease:,"It feels great. There is how he played (before the injury), and you also saw how hard he worked to get himself ready, especially in the last three weeks or so. He has been right there, and there is just one last little hurdle for him to get over. You want to get him back in the net. He is an important guy for our team."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-game-36-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Max Pacioretty on the holiday break and the two losses preceding it:,"I got to relax a lot and rest, which I definitely needed. The schedule got a little bit hectic there at the end for our group, and it definitely showed in our game. It was nice to relax and spend time with the family. Now, we’re back at it. It was obvious that everyone needed a little bit of a rest there. Every team deals with it where teams are waiting for you, and it seems like you’ve been traveling every day and playing a lot. It is a good lesson that in those situations, you have to tighten up defensively and maybe hold down the fort a little bit better than we did. But those situations build teams and make teams who they are. We had there days to rest. We are going to play a desperate team that is going to want to impress their new coach and make a bit of a statement. There is going to be a lot of intensity out there tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-game-36-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,New Red Wings head coach Todd McLellan on the message to his new team:,"We aren’t coming in here, waving a wand and changing forecheck, neutral zone, d-zone coverages, and power play. We just don’t have time. But what we have asked the players to do is play harder, play faster, and play a little bit smarter. Those are three things we can change without any type of tactics, systematic or structure play. The last thing is that the spirit of the team has to improve. When something like this happens, the spirit is at a low. We are going to work hard to build it back up. We are going to focus a lot more on what is happening from minute one to minute 60. I know there is a history of being in the playoffs, not being in the playoffs, winning streaks and losing streaks. The players have to answer those questions — that is their duty, and they have to do it — but I am asking them to focus on what happens when they put the equipment on, focus on that, and not carry any baggage with them to the rink about where we are in the standings. Let’s play and figure each other out."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-game-36-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Morgan Rielly on the instant impact of a coaching change on a locker room:,"Whenever it happens, as players, you think a lot about why your team is in that situation. I have been there. I would expect that group over there to be competitive and motivated to come out hard. There is always some kind of a response when something like that happens."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-game-36-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Rielly on the team’s two losses without Auston Matthews before the break:,"When he is out, we need other players to take on more responsibility, and I think we can play a more well-rounded game that is a bit more complete. If you look at those games, I don’t think the starts were the best. That’s going to be an area of focus."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-game-36-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the first game back from the break:,"You get some rest, right? We’ve played a lot of hockey and have had a lot of back-to-backs. We’re starting out again with a back-to-back, but we got to rest and energize. The energy should be good. With three days off, there are timing issues and things like that — execution — so we have to simplify our game tonight, play a pretty simple hockey game, and make sure we are predictable to each other. It is about competing, working hard, and playing hard."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-game-36-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the areas for improvement coming off of the two losses before the break:,"We always talk offense, offense. We had chances to score in the last couple. It didn’t go in, but it is the other side of the puck that is more concerning for me. We gave up three goals to Winnipeg that were easily corrected, in my opinion. I talk about details, stick details, and the little things we have to be better at. That is the focus here."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/10/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-game-28-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the challenge presented by the Devils:,They have some great players over there with tons of speed and talent. Their power play is number one in the league. They play a good brand of hockey. They do a lot with the puck and make a lot of plays. They have great speed. Very good power play.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/10/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-game-28-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on whether there are lessons to be learned from the 4-2 win over the Devils in the second game of the season:,"You always look at how we played against them, what we did well, and things you can take away. But things have changed, too, with their team and our team. Again, we have to check well tonight. We have to take away their speed as best we can and be disciplined."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/10/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-game-28-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the differences and similarities between Mitch Marner and Jack Hughes:,"Jack is the type of guy who attacks with a little bit more speed and is looking to shoot a bit more than Mitch. Mitch is more of a pass-first guy who is looking for people who are open. Jack is an elite playmaker, but he shoots a lot. He gets shots through and to the net."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/10/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-game-28-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the keys to the bottom six providing more offensively:,"Put the puck in the net. They’ve had opportunities. I don’t think it is from a lack of opportunities. They have done a good job of hounding in the offensive zone, being heavy down low, getting pucks to the net, and trying to score greasy goals around the net. That is how they are going to score. They are doing a good job of getting to the net, too. When it goes low-to-high and our D are shooting pucks, they are at the net. They just have to dig in a little more around there, find some loose pucks, and bang them home. It is a simple brand of hockey that they need to play. It is not all about scoring with those guys, either. Their job is to check, be physical, and do all of these other things, too. They are doing a good job of it, but we do need guys to contribute a little bit in the bottom six."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/10/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-game-28-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Max Pacioretty on his role on the Matthews-Marner line:,"I feel I can help those guys in the sense of digging up loose pucks for them, getting in on the forecheck, being physical, creating some time and space, and getting to the net so they can kind of play their game and find their lanes. I’ve told a few people that I have a lot more appreciation for some of the guys I played with earlier in my career who did a lot of the dirty work. It is fun being able to change things up a bit and try to help those guys out with a bit of a different role. Hopefully, we can get a bit of chemistry and get hot."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/10/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-game-28-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Sheldon Keefe on the challenge presented by the Maple Leafs:,"They have premiere players who are difference-makers. In their team play, they make it hard to get to their net. Their goaltending has been as good as there is in the league. There are a lot of challenges there. We have to lead with our work ethic and our competitiveness, and make sure we are ready to skate and compete at a high level tonight. Hopefully, we hope we can make some differences when the opportunities present themselves."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/10/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-game-28-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on the emotions entering the second matchup of the season vs. his former team:,"Honestly, it feels a little more like just another game on the schedule. We saw them once already. It was so early, fresh, and new on so many levels. Now, in preparing for them, it feels like another team — another great team — on the schedule. We have had number of challenges, whether it is Florida, Carolina, Washington, or teams of that nature. This team is no different in terms of every detail needing to be great tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/10/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-game-28-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,"Keefe,in an interview with Jonas Siegel, on the Leafs’ defensive play during his time and where the team ultimately fell short:","I look back to my time in Toronto as hard to compute, quite honestly. Because we were one way in the regular season. At times, we scored a lot. At times, (we) didn’t defend nearly well enough; at times, (we) did. I think we don’t get enough credit for defending like we did. And then we get into the playoffs and I don’t think defending was ever really an issue. We couldn’t score. That part of it is difficult. But it’s just a reminder for me of how hard we need to push to be able to learn to score in different ways in the regular season (with the Devils). So no matter what we approach in the playoffs, we can deal with it. But yeah, that was one of the things. We talk a lot in Toronto about trying to be better defensively. I don’t think that’s ever why we lost in the playoffs. You look back at all these Game 7s and all these series that we could have won before getting to Game 7, the number of opportunities we have to score goals or not being able to generate enough. That’s the big reason why we lost. And that doesn’t necessarily jive with the perception of the team, say, in the regular season. … You look back, you watch that Boston series (in 2024), we played very well defensively. We played very hard. We were right there, even with no Auston or no Willy. Even (Bobby) McMann was a big loss for us. I thought we were right there, could have won that series. This Montreal series that we lost (in 2021). I look back at that and I remember going back through it. We lost two games in overtime when we had them facing elimination. We had 15 two-on-ones in that series, and 11 of them came in our four losses, and we scored on zero. So it’s like, we score on a couple of those, the series is over, and then who knows what happens from there. But it’s little things like that. We gotta be able to come through in big moments and condition yourself to do so. Clearly, I didn’t do a good enough job of that. But I do think our group pulled together and defended hard when we needed to. There were certainly times when we didn’t do it enough in the regular season. But there are also times when we did it extremely well, and we made a lot of gains in that area. Sometimes, we dealt with a lot of stuff on the back end. We dealt with some stuff in goal that affected us."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/10/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-game-28-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on the comment from MLSE CEO Keith Pelley that the “chemistry wasn’t quite right” between Keefe and management:,"I’ve never had a real conversation with Keith Pelley before, so I don’t know what that is. I spent hours and hours with (Brad). I was surprised that I was back (as Leafs coach) a year ago. … Probably nobody in the organization there knows me better than Brendan Shanahan, who worked so closely with me and with everything from “Blueprint” or the Amazon show, has probably watched hundreds of hours behind the scenes of me working, and probably knows me better than anybody in hockey; (he) decided to keep me around."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Sheldon Keefe on scratching TJ Brodie:,"We just think it is an opportunity for us to give him a little bit of time off and lighten the workload a little bit. He has taken on a lot for us. Brods knows he hasn’t been at his best this season for most of the season, and yet he has taken on a lot for us. We have been through a lot with our defense, in particular, throughout the season, and he has consistently been there each night taking on most of the hardest matchups every single night. It has been a lot. It is a chance for us to give him a night off and also get Timmins back involved. Lyubushkin is not on the trip and is still not available."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Keefe on the challenge presented by the surging Capitals:,"They have been a resilient group. They have found ways to win and found ways, if it is slipping away, to bring it back. It is a credit to Spencer (Carbery) and his coaching staff as well as the players for how they have bought in. They are a really good mix of a team right now. They have really solid veterans who have won before. They have young guys who have taken steps and taken advantage of their opportunities. They have gotten terrific goaltending. All of those things have come together. They are playing loose and free and doing what they can to get into the playoffs. They will be a hungry team again tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Capitals head coach — and formerLeafsassistant coach — Spencer Carberyon Auston Matthews’ huge goal-scoring season:,He has been outstanding all year. I heard Sheldon talk about it a little earlier this year — and I can see it — regarding health. He looks like he is 100% healthy ripping the puck. I worked with him a lot on the power play. His one-timer now from the dot — where Leon Draisaitl hits it a lot — looks as good as I have ever seen it in the years I spent with him. He is a threat over there as a one-timer. He is now feeling like that 60-goal year where he is stepping into areas off of the rush where he is just pulling and snapping it and it is coming off hot. 70 is not out of reach for him.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Carbery on the keys to keeping Matthews quiet:,"With the shot, similar to Bedard, off the rush, you really have to be careful with your gaps and make sure he is not getting you backed into the top of the circles and closer. That’s where, even if you are in front of him, if he gets into that area, look out. He can pull it through your triangle and shoot through your feet. The thing I think that he does better than anybody in the world is his ability to win 50-50 pucks, pull them off the yellow, take contact, and spin-off. It is as good as I have ever seen. That’s what separates him, having that body and strength on the puck. He will go into confrontation for a 50-50 puck, and — because he is so smart, strong, and quick — he comes out with those pucks 80% of the time, whether it is a forecheck puck or an o-zone spray. Our D need to do a really good job, when they close on him, of being heavy on their stick. You have to use your body control so that he is not spinning off of you. If he gets five, six or 10 of those pucks tonight in the offensive zone, they usually turn into scoring chances and trouble for you defensively."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Carbery on what former Capital Joel Edmundson will bring to theMaple Leafs:,"I think he is a great addition to their team not only with what he does on the ice — from a physical standpoint, he defends so well and is hard at the net front — but also from a leadership standpoint. His teammates really, really like him. He is a calming presence. He is not boisterous and loud or the most vocal guy in the room, but he has a real calming presence to him. I think guys really appreciate and respect that about him. He has won a Stanley Cup, and you can see why a guy like that has had so much success and been on a lot of good teams in his career."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Carbery on Alex Ovechkin’s recent play (12 goals in 20 games since the All-Star break):,"Pucks are going in the net for him. He has done a really nice job on the power play. We have integrated some changes with him moving around a little bit more frequently. Post All-Star break, it is almost like he smells that these are the most important games of the year. His competitiveness and what he is doing inside of his game — his level of detail away from the puck, his leadership on the bench/locker room — is more engaged. He is trying to get guys to do the right things and make winning plays. You can tell he has been through this a long time — 19 years now — and this time of year is his time to shine. He really, really wants to get his game to a higher level and also our entire group’s as our captain."

He is just in the zone right now. His consistently starting games has helped as well.

He has done it his whole career. I have the most confidence in him. Going back to last season, it doesn’t matter who was between the pipes. You knew he was going to bring it. I think our group has already seen the flashes of it in the preseason with some of the big saves he has made. Those are a little more flashy; he is usually just calm and collected in the net. Whether it is Woller or [Hildeby] in net, we have great depth in the system. They are all big guys who take up a lot of net. It is pretty intimidating to be a shooter against those guys. It will be a good test for [Stolarz], but I know he is up for it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-game-1-projected-lines-tv-info/,Max Pacioretty on Anthony Stolarz:,"Really, really, really good goalie. I don’t think I scored a single goal on him in the first four or five practices. It was starting to get me pretty upset. He is massive in there. He is really big and takes up a lot of net. It is easy to say he is big, but sometimes, big goalies have holes, whether it is a hole down by their feet or whatnot. He is just a very big presence in the net, and it is hard to see any net when he is in there. In the first four or five days, it was like, “Am I going to score a goal on this guy in practice all year?” It is why teams want to draft big goalies and why a lot of the top goalies are big. He is athletic. He is a special player."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-game-1-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the team’s confidence in Dennis Hildeby in the fill-in backup role:,"He had a good camp and played a really good, strong game in preseason. He is young, and I didn’t know him before I got here, but he looks really comfortable, calm, and cool in the net. He is a big goalie who takes up a lot of net."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-game-1-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on Max Pacioretty earning a contract and a spot in the opening-night lineup:,"We weren’t sure, with the injuries he has had in the last few years. It has been hard on him. To me, he looked better and better as camp went on along, getting his feet under him. We like his ability to score goals, number one. Number two, he is a big, strong guy who can hang onto pucks in the offensive zone. He is a veteran player who is responsible."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-game-1-projected-lines-tv-info/,Pacioretty on the feeling of entering his old stomping grounds in Montreal:,"I don’t think too much about that anymore. I am just grateful to be here playing this game. I know it is a big storyline — I have been asked about it a lot — and I have a lot of friends here who work in the building. But truthfully, I am at the stage in my career where I am just thankful to be here, and I take every day as a blessing."

We are all trying to achieve the same thing together. They have a ton of skill in here. Being able to play different roles in the lineup is going to be important for me and the team, whether it is to bring some physicality or help out some young guys. I took on a role like that last year, and it was new for me to play down the lineup and help out some young guys. I think our line last year helped get the [Capitals] to the playoffs. It is a bit of a different situation than you’re used to compared to when you are 22 years old scoring at the Bell Centre and feeling like you are the man, but at the same time, you have to take less to help the team. I am at that stage in my career where there are different opportunities to help the team win games. I am looking forward to it."

Personally, I have a lot to prove that I can help a team. There are different ways you can help a team win. We have some of the best offensive players in the world here. People wondered, “Why are you going there,” but there is a good team with a chance to win. Sometimes, you have to take less to win. That is the situation I am in right now. I am not just here to score goals or do some of the things I have done in the past. I am in a different stage of my career now. Looking forward to it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-game-1-projected-lines-tv-info/,Simon Benoit on his first-ever opening-day game in the NHL:,"This is pretty special. It is my fourth year in the NHL, but it is my first opening night. I am pretty pumped about it. I worked hard for this. I am excited about tonight, especially knowing it is Montreal in front of family. It’s cool."

https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-game-1-projected-lines-tv-info/,Martin St. Louis on his goaltending situation entering the new season:,"Sam (Montembeault), in the last few years, has separated himself a little bit. To the point where I am going to say he is going to be the number one all season? I can’t say that, but I would say that he is getting the first game. On a back-to-back, you are going to see both, and then we are going to manage the schedule based on their performance. Both goaltenders (Montembeault and Primeau) progressed very well. I expect the same. I am not going to sit here and say Monty is going to be the number one all season, but I think he has an opportunity to do that. We are very confident in that position based on what we saw last year. If we can [tighten] things up in front of them, it is going to be easier for them to continue progressing."

He said, “No, no.” I told him he is pretty strong and knows how to do it. He was pretty modest in saying no. I am happy to have him on this side of it and not do that again."

You can’t get strung out by him, that’s for sure. You have to try to stay a little bit inside or you are not going to be able to reach him. I have long arms, but not 6’7 long. It is definitely different from [O’Brien vs. Arizona], but not anything I’ve never dealt with."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-rangers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Reaves on the anticipation of knowing a fight might happen:,"It’s every game. Especially when I was younger, it was every game. Every team had somebody. It wasn’t anything different. I don’t go into any game thinking I am fighting for sure, but when there is someone who is a taker on the other side who is probably hungry for it, you are aware of it, but you have a game to play, too."

Lyubushkin himself — at that time — brought a lot to our team in terms of physicality and competitiveness, making it hard to enter our zone and hard to be around our net. It was something that we really needed at that time. You still need it. We have improved in that area with our team mindset as well as some of our personnel — McCabe and Benoit — and Lyubushkin will add to that. He seemed to complement Morgan well and bring out the best in him. Part of it is what Lyubushkin brings and part of it is how it impacts the rest of the group and enhances everybody else, especially when you couple that with Liljegren coming back. Now you get Rielly a partner he has played well with and it’s a good place to start with Lyubushkin coming in with some familiarity. We get Brodie on the left side, too. Just that one move is able to snap some things into place for us. We like the look of it. We will monitor it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-rangers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Peter Laviolette on the challenge presented by the Leafs:,They have only lost a couple of games in their last 10. They are doing the right things and finding ways to win hockey games. It will be good to go out there and test ourselves. They are a dynamic team with a lot of good players. I think the guys are looking forward to it. It is always fun coming to Toronto and playing a good hockey team.

He finds ways to score goals and he scores them from everywhere. It goes back to the conversation about the other players. They have lots of them. They are high-octane. We have to make sure we’re ready to play good defense. Keep things in check, keep things in front of us, and defend well. If you can do that, you have a chance to be successful."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-rangers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Laviolette on Igor Shesterkin’s 7-0-0 hot streak (.953 save percentage):,"He seems like he is moving and tracking really well. When I watch him play, he seems to be on it. On some of the saves he’s making, he sees two things happening over there when something is happening over here. He is focused, and he knows where he is at. He seems to be in sync with everything that he is doing inside the crease."

He jumped up into the rush and won a battle to slide the puck in front for two good initial looks for Knies and Matthews before Knies found Matthews in front for the goal.

How quickly Knies executed under the time pressure combined with the composure to still pick his spot with his shot so well — vs. panicking or rushing it off his stick — made for one of the more memorable goals of the season.","KNIES SCORES WITH 0.1 SECONDS LEFT ON THE CLOCK!

He is tough to play against, especially in the corners. He can also make a good first pass and keep the offense going. He has more offense than people give him credit for probably because his biggest asset is his size and aggressiveness, but he is a pretty smart player in possession."

Keep finding that consistency of level of play. We are coming off of a really good road trip. I thought we went toe-to-toe for 50 minutes with Carolina. We ran into penalties midway through the third, which made it harder to get back in the game. Our team game is solid. We just have to keep the consistency down the stretch and keep winning games."

I think he is a smart player with lots of detail in his game and awareness defensively. There is stability that way, I think. He has the flexibility to play both center and wing. We like that about him. It increases the depth and it’s a guy who can help us on the defensive side, and yet, he probably doesn’t get enough love for the fact that he has 10 goals already playing on the fourth line in Minnesota. There is some upside offensively at the same time."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Keefe on inserting Joel Edmundson into the lineup and sitting Simon Benoit:,"Just looking at it, I feel like we need Liljegren’s right shot. We also want to put Liljegren with Edmundson to see how it can come together for us. This is an important time in Liljegren’s development for us to settle in. We are through the trade deadline. We know what our group looks like. We will give Lily a chance to grow within the role and with Edmundson. We like how the other pairs are set up. That is really it. Quite frankly, it kills me to have to sit Benoit tonight, especially in this building, but I didn’t make the schedule and it is what is necessary for our team tonight."

Obviously, we’re matched up against a very good line on the other side that can really make you pay if you give them odd man rushes or chances against.

We were pretty good with how they worked out. Both teams are top six/bottom six, and you have to be smart about how you manage it and get outside of that. They really focused on Auston and his line with how they utilized their defense. We will be able to manage that a little bit better at home and make it a little more difficult for them. At the same time, that line has been doing really well. We have to manage the matchups accordingly so that we are not chasing one to get something favourable over here while exposing ourselves on the other side of it — especially with the way we have been playing without different people."

I always knew how good he was defensively, but seeing him up close and personal on the same team, he is, in my opinion, the best defensive defenseman in the league. I have never seen a stick like his with the amount of plays he breaks up, the shots that he blocks, and he’s still able to make great passes out of the defensive zone.

We played a good first period and did some really good things, but they come at you. They are a pressure team. We all know that. They are in your face and don’t give you a lot of room. In the second period, they took the game over. We have to handle that pressure better and simplify our game. We didn’t simplify enough in the second period, ended up playing too much in our own end, and did some things that were uncharacteristic of our team just from their pressure. You have to handle their pressure. They are going to come at you — they’re an aggressive team that doesn’t give you a lot of time and space out there."

I have been trying to adjust [to taking care of my details first] in these first couple of games, and it got to me a bit. I am trying to build on my first couple of games and play a bit more free while balancing those two things. Just keep moving my feet. I was thinking a little bit too much out there.

It is a little bit more of that old-school mentality that isn’t really around the league as much as it was when I was playing at my best. It reminds me a lot of a guy like Mark Stone. I mentioned a guy like Aho — more give-and-go hockey, moving it quickly. [Tavares] is always in the right place at the right time. It is so obvious. With guys like that, you understand why they are so good, but when you play with them, you understand on a whole new level.

It is just [Brendan Gallagher] left from when I was there. It is just a normal game for me."

I had a lot of opportunities to hang onto pucks last game, especially down low in the offensive zone, where I wasn’t able to or kind of forced the play. My bread and butter is holding onto pucks in the offensive zone and wearing down defensemen. That is an area I definitely want to improve on."

I knew I was going to feel good, but I didn’t think this good. Coming in for training, the skates have been really, really hard, but the staff here is unlike anything I have seen in terms of the resources for training and recovery. Again, at my age, you have to take everything into consideration when you are trying to feel as best as you can. This is a great place for that. They have a guy for everything. It is a luxury to have, especially at my age."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/09/26/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-preseason-game-3-projected-lines-tv-info/,Nick Robertson on the difference when William Nylander plays center instead of the wing:,"It maybe gets him more speed because he is lower. He can get the puck first as an F1 in the defensive zone. With the puck on his stick, obviously, he is dangerous. Maybe an F1 spot at center gets the puck on his stick a little more. We will see how it goes."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/09/26/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-preseason-game-3-projected-lines-tv-info/,Robertson on the areas of emphasis under Craig Berube:,"Playing north and playing heavy—that is something we can get better at, myself included. I will continue to work on that and on the things in the defensive zone that are a little different and build confidence in them."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/09/26/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-preseason-game-3-projected-lines-tv-info/,Max Domi on his impressions of Berube and his first training camp so far:,"He is the man. Everyone loves him. It is dialed up in terms of intensity. They are not quite as long in terms of the skates, but 45-50 minutes as hard as possible for every rep is how you get into game shape. It is an NHL training camp. It is good to see."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/26/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Sheldon Keefe on the goals for tonight’s game against the Devils:,Let’s build on our last effort that we had [at home]. It is another team with high-octane offense and skill. They will make you pay in transition if you give them easy ice. There are a lot of reasons for us to be dialed in tonight and bring an effort similar to Edmonton.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/26/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Keefe on the challenge against the Devils under interim head coach Travis Green:,"They are in a fight for the playoffs, but they have always been a great offensive team. They haven’t taken a step back in that area in terms of generating chances and the skill that they possess, but they play a much better team game defensively. That is a credit to how Greener has been able to keep it going."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/26/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Travis Green on his second opportunity running an NHL bench:,"It is like anything in life. You get better the more you do things. I had a break. You get to look back at yourself and evaluate yourself in certain areas. That is important, not just in hockey but in all areas of life. I think I am a better coach today than I was. I wanted to coach. I love coaching. The Devils have a real bright future. Coaching with Lindy (Ruff) was going to be another way to learn and get better as well. This is not the way I envisioned being behind the bench as a head coach, but sometimes, things happen. It has been a process since day one behind the bench to install my thoughts on coaching and how teams should play. I like the way things are progressing."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/26/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Green on his memories of playing for theLeafsduring his playing career:,Great ones. It is a great place to play with the passion in the city. Every player likes to come and play against theLeafs. I remember that well as a player. But I think every player enjoys playing for theLeafsas well. Special place.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/26/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Green on the challenges against the currentLeafsteam:,It is no secret they are one of the better teams in the league. They have skill. They are fast. They can make plays. We have been talking about our game a lot in the last 10-11 games and how we have to play to have success. We are going to have to be on top of our game. There is not one area you have to be good at. You have to be good in all areas to beat teams like this.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/26/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Keefe on Joseph Woll starting his second consecutive:,"If the last game was any indication, he is building momentum and getting back into a groove. That was why getting him back in the net tonight was important. He has had some tough starts here, right? He has been on the tail end of back-to-backs. He has played some tough opponents. Getting him into this one tonight was important for a lot of reasons — not just the way he played last game, but also getting him the extra start. With Samsonov having the little bump in the road with an injury, it allows that opportunity and makes it fall into place or makes the decision somewhat easier in that sense. He is building momentum. He looked great the other night."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/26/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Bobby McMann on Woll’s 41-save performance in Carolina:,"He faced a lot of shots and a lot of grade-As, too. Credit to him for stopping them for us. We gave up a few too many chances. That is just the regular for him, though. He is an elite competitor. He is always ready to go."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/26/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,McMann on the keys to turning it around on the penalty kill:,"Pressure. We are a little bit in between. When you aren’t having success, you start to second-guess it a little bit. You are a little bit in between and thinking about it rather than reacting. I think we can just react, play hockey, and pressure their guys."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/03/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-preseason-game-5-projected-lines-tv-info/,Max Pacioretty on how close to full speed he feels within his own game:,It is tough to tell. I had a good first game. The second game — not so much. Camp has been very difficult in a good way. I like where the pace is at and where my game is at. I’ll have a better indication after tonight.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/03/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-preseason-game-5-projected-lines-tv-info/,Pacioretty on getting to know the character that is Nikita Grebenkin:,He was wearing a sleeveless shirt all trip. I don’t think he took it off the whole time we were there.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/03/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-preseason-game-5-projected-lines-tv-info/,Steven Lorentz on getting to know Grebenkin:,"He is a great kid, and his English is actually coming along pretty well, too. It was nice to get to know him a little bit up in Muskoka. He is a really friendly kid. He sat at the table a couple of times, and you can tell he is really trying to say what is on his mind. A couple of times, he had to pull up the translator on the phone and show us. Really nice kid. Humble. Super bubbly. He has that infectious personality you want to be around. It has been great getting to know him."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/03/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-preseason-game-5-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on how close Easton Cowan is to making the team:,"He is a good player. He is there, you know? He is going to be in the game tonight. We will see how it goes."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/03/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-preseason-game-5-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on his expectations for Cowan tonight:,He does what he does with the puck. He can make plays. He is very good at that. He’s a good offensive player. He has to be responsible defensively and manage the game more than anything.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/03/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-preseason-game-5-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on what he is looking for in the final preseason games:,"We are looking to see what the guys in the game today can do. They are right there. We have decisions to make. In the game today, they are going to go up against a good lineup. We will see how they perform."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/03/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-detroit-red-wings-preseason-game-5-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on his early impressions of Marshall Rifai’s game:,His aggressiveness and his physicality as a defenseman. He is very involved out there. He keeps the game simple. He is hard to play against.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Mike Sullivan on Auston Matthews’ 70-goal chase:,"He is clearly one of the elite goal-scorers in the league and can score goals in so many different ways. I think his two-game has evolved a lot. He is a +30-something player. He is playing the game the right way, scoring goals and producing offense. That is an evolution players go through, especially the elite players when they are young and start to evolve. That is how it appears to me, at least from afar. He is clearly one of the league’s dominant players. Any time he is on the ice, we have to pay attention."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Sullivan on the team’s recent push to make up ground in the playoff race:,"I think we have a proud group and an accomplished group. These guys have a desire to win. They have a desire to compete in the playoffs. They are competing extremely hard to try to get us there. From a coaching standpoint, watching them compete over the last couple of weeks has been fun. We have gotten ourselves back in this race, but we recognize we have a lot of work ahead of us. We have a big challenge tonight. We have been focused on the one game in front of us. That is what we will continue to do."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Sullivan on Sidney Crosby’s leadership during the Penguins’ push for the playoffs:,"I run out of phrases to explain Sid’s overall game and contribution to help the Penguins win. He is an incredibly driven kid. He cares so much about winning. He cares a lot about the Penguins and our success. He plays an inspired game. He is the heartbeat of this team. I have said it on so many occasions. He is doing everything in his power to help us get to the playoffs. He is our go-to guy on both sides of the puck. He has a complete game. He has a mature game. He has an impact on both sides of the puck. The biggest thing for me: Yeah, he has a 40-goal season and it is remarkable what he is doing offensively, but what flies under the radar is his commitment to playing the game the right way and his commitment to playing defense. It is an important aspect of winning, and he gets it. He leads by example in that regard."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Sullivan on Michael Bunting’s impact on the Penguins since joining the team at the trade deadline:,He has given us lots of juice. He plays a hard game because he is always in the battle areas. That is not an easy game to play. You are in a lot of confrontations. You take a lot of cross-checks and facewashes. He is willing to pay the price to score goals. An important aspect of scoring in this league is a willingness to get inside and pay the price. He has scored a lot of blue-paint goals from two feet in and around the blue paint. A significant number of goals are scored in that area in the league. I think he has been really complementary with Geno’s line. I think he has kind of dragged Geno into the fight in the down-low grind game. Geno is getting inside with some of the goals Geno has scored lately. I think that is what he does for us. He plays a hard game because he is playing in the hard areas of the rink.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Sidney Crosby on Auston Matthews’ run at 70 goals:,"It’s crazy. Looking at different years — big years — from other guys, 70 just seems like a crazy number. But he could do it. It’s amazing. It speaks a lot to the consistency he has had. But yeah, that’s a crazy number."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Crosby on the keys to his line’s success and the team’s success of late:,"We are just trying to compete. As a line, we are keeping it simple. We aren’t forcing things that aren’t there, but we are playing hard. I think everyone is playing the same type of game regardless of line or production. Regardless of who goes out there, everyone is playing the same way. It has been the reason for our success."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Michael Bunting on returning to Toronto as a member of the Penguins:,"Coming back home to play an old team is always fun. It is easy to wake up for this game, especially with how big this game is for us. We are fighting for our lives. We know it is a big one. I will be ready to go."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Sheldon Keefe on facing a desperate opponent with everything to play for:,"It gets your attention, right? You know you are going to be in for a game tonight. The challenge is going to be on us to match their urgency level and the competitiveness level. That is what we talked about this morning: knowing that the other team is coming in here with a real purpose. Our purpose has to remain to play a good, sound game in a game that means a lot to the opposition. We have to pull that same meaning out of it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Keefe on the Penguins’ push for a playoff berth:,"I don’t follow it that closely, but each time we have been preparing to play Pittsburgh throughout the season, you look at it and see they are doing a lot of really good things as a team. It hasn’t always fallen into place for them, but I am not surprised that they have had a push here with the leadership group they have on the ice and their culture over there. It makes a lot of sense when you look at their team, look at their players, and look at the guys who drive the bus for them. It is good to see them making a push and making things interesting. It is a good challenge for us tonight. We want to do our part to make it hard on them."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,John Tavares on Crosby leading the Penguins to the cusp of a playoff berth:,"I don’t think it is surprising. You are talking about the most accomplished player of this generation, whether individually or from a team perspective. The internal drive has shown from day one of his career. Tonight should be a great challenge against a team that is as desperate as anybody and is playing great hockey. The highlights of their recent games show the emotion they are playing with."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Bobby McMann on sharing the ice with Crosby:,"Times when I thought I had the puck or I thought I could get the puck off his stick, he moved it before I could even get close. He kind of baits you in and throws it behind you and steps around you. You always have to be aware of the plays he is going to make."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-nashville-predators-game-25-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Chris Tanev on the challenge of blocking Steven Stamkos’ shot:,"He has hurt me a few times. We all know how good [his shot] is and where it is coming from. He has scored hundreds of goals from the same general vicinity. He is a hell of a player and a hell of a goal scorer. I have known Stammer for a long time, and I can’t say a bad word about him. He is a true pro who works his ass off and is a hell of a player."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-nashville-predators-game-25-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Tanev on Roman Josi’s game:,"He controls the play and dictates the pace of the game because he is up in the play a lot and has the puck a lot. He is one of those guys, and there are not many who can control the flow and pace of the game [like him]."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-nashville-predators-game-25-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the challenge presented by the Predators:,"If I look at their team over the last 10 games, they have really tightened things up, in my opinion. Defensively, they’ve gotten a lot better. I think they’ve had five OT losses in those games. Their record could be a lot better. They have good veterans over there. I am not going to name them all. They have a really good goalie. It is a challenge. It’s a desperate team with the situation they are in. We need to be ready to go to match that desperation."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-nashville-predators-game-25-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the team’s play without Jake McCabe in Monday night’s win:,"Pretty good. Our first period was really good, I thought, but in the second period, we got sloppy with our play and our identity. We got a little loose. We got better in the third. Without McCabe, we did a good job. Our penalty kill was really good in the game. For the most part, I thought we defended pretty well, other than the second period. The second period wasn’t so much about defending as it was about turning pucks over more than anything."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-nashville-predators-game-25-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Oliver Ekman-Larsson on the challenge vs. the Predators and theLeafs‘ goals for tonight:,"We didn’t play the way we wanted [on Monday night]. We have been trying to clear those things up, play a little faster, and not turn pucks over at the line. Our focus is on our game, but we also know they are probably going to come out hard and are a desperate team over there. We have to match it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-nashville-predators-game-25-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Nick Robertson on the difference on the bench when Ryan Reaves is in the lineup:,"It’s definitely a little louder, even in the locker room. His presence on the ice is known, and he is a great locker-room guy. He gets the guys going. We are happy to have him back in the lineup with his physicality. He is physical and hard on pucks. That’s what we need."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-nashville-predators-game-25-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Robertson on the Predators:,Their record probably doesn’t show good they are. They have some talented players and made some big additions this past summer. We don’t want to take it lightly. We want to go out and make it hard on them.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/17/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Jon Cooper on the level of intensity he is anticipating for this matchup given the lack of stakes and the emphasis on staying healthy:,"I have coached in a few of these, and they are tough to predict. Some have been nailbiters. For some, no one touches each other out there. I am not sure what is going to happen other than the fact that there are probably two storylines everyone is looking for. Some TV networks have picked this game up because of the anticipation of something happening (laughs). On a night when there is not a ton going on, this is one that will probably have a lot of eyes on it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/17/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Cooper on whether he is going to coach any differently to help Nikita Kucherov reach 100 assists:,"If we were going to coach differently, Sheldon and I would both pull our goalie in the first five minutes and make it 6-on-5. Stats don’t go against them. Get them over with. In the end, would anyone really remember that? Probably not. It does make for great TV. Clearly, I am pulling for #86 to get his 100th assist. What a remarkable accomplishment that would be. You look at the other side, and for #34 to get 70 and to say you were in the building, as a fan, it would be super cool to see. The problem is I am the coach of the other team. We have to find a way to prevent that. He has done it 69 times against a whole bunch of other teams trying to prevent it. It is hard to do. We will see what happens."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/17/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Sheldon Keefe on the decision to play Auston Matthews in a meaningless game #82:,"We have 12 forwards, so it wasn’t much of a discussion, quite honestly. There were brief discussions about 11 and 7, but to me, the 70 goals aside, Auston is feeling good and playing good. If we had more guys to sit and rest, he probably wouldn’t be at the top of the list for me, quite honestly. It was not much of a discussion there. I like that we are able to give some of our defensemen some rest. Those guys are banged up, and they’re important. They’ve taken on a lot for us this season. We get to use the depth we have on the backend there."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/17/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Keefe on the meaninglessness of the game:,"It is a tricky one on both sides. You need to play the games. It is an 82-game schedule. You want to get through it with good habits and good detail. But, of course, health is the most important thing. But it is on the schedule, and you have to play the games. That is really it. We want to feel good about our game coming out of it. The reality is, whether we feel good about it or not, we are going to wash it, move on, and be ready for Saturday."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/17/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Keefe on the state of the team’s game going into the playoffs:,"I feel good about it. We have played a lot of good hockey in the last couple of months. It hasn’t been perfect. There are times and things we haven’t liked for sure, but how much of it is our team game? How much of it is the nature of the fact that, in essence, we have not been playing for very much in the last little while? If you look around the league, there are a lot of situations where teams are just biding their time to get through the regular season. I have seen a lot of good things from our team. I look at our first period on the road last night against a really good team that did have something to play for. Of course, we weren’t able to sustain and hold it all the way through, but to me, when we have really needed to call on it, I have really liked how our group has played. That gives us confidence going in."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/17/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Keefe on managing the minutes for tonight:,"I do have an idea, but we will play the game. Our guys who don’t play as much will certainly play more tonight, so we will manage it that way. We have to see how the flow of the game goes. In some cases, as a coach, a lot of the questions come, and the focus is on the minutes. You don’t necessarily control the minutes and seconds. You control the shifts. The game itself kind of works out the flow of the minutes and where they land with special teams and whatnot. Last night, there were a ton of special teams. There was a lot to manage there in terms of the minutes. There were long periods of time with guys sitting, which is never a good thing. We will see what the game brings. Hopefully, it has some good flow, and we can get out of here quickly."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/17/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Cooper on how wide open the playoffs are in the Eastern Conference:,"Remember 2019? It was pretty set for us to go all the way. We were out in six days. It is hard for me to answer those questions when it is anybody’s game. When you are in a league with 32 teams, it is tough to win. When you chop that in half and get the top 16, it is the best of the best. The margin of victory and defeat is so fine. You just need things to go your way and you need to stay healthy. These are tough ones to predict. You never know. That is what makes these playoffs so amazing."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/12/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-ottawa-senators-game-17-preview-projected-lines-tv-info-2/,Travis Green on the importance of the special teams battle tonight:,"Especially on the road… There are a lot of nights when, if you lose the special teams on the road, it is a hard night. That’s the case on the home or the road, really. Toronto’s power play is starting to go now. Our penalty kill is going to have to be sharp."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/12/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-ottawa-senators-game-17-preview-projected-lines-tv-info-2/,Green on the Senators’ top-five power play (31.1%):,"We’ve got skilled players who are working together. What I like about it is that they are showing they can score in different ways. With the way the penalty kill is today, if you are predictable on the power play, it is a lot easier to defend. They have been working hard at it. [Mike Yeo] and [Daniel Alfredsson] do a good job with them, and the guys are buying in."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/12/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-ottawa-senators-game-17-preview-projected-lines-tv-info-2/,Bobby McMann on the keys to success on the second line with Tavares and Nylander:,"Continuing to stick with my game and play to my strengths. That is winning puck battles, competing hard, and trying to win those one-on-one battles to get the puck to the guys I am playing. You are trying to bring what you can and bring an identity to whatever line you are playing on. The guys I am playing with tonight are great with the puck. It is about trying to get them the puck and work to get pucks back. We’ll go from there. On any line, whether you are first or fourth line, it’s about trying to win battles and get the puck in your hands."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/12/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-ottawa-senators-game-17-preview-projected-lines-tv-info-2/,Jake McCabe on the team’s defensive success recently:,"Our commitment to tracking through the neutral zone from our forwards allows us to have some good gaps on the backend. In zone, I think we are doing a pretty good job of protecting the middle of the ice. Our box-outs have been good, and we’ve been eliminating second chances and blocking shots."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/12/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-ottawa-senators-game-17-preview-projected-lines-tv-info-2/,McCabe on the benefits of playing with a partner of Chris Tanev’s calibre:,It’s the steadiness that he provides as a partner. He seems like he is always in the right spot and is talking out there. He makes the right plays with the puck. It is contagious. We both have the same mindset as it relates to shutting down the opponent’s top lines and doing our job.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/12/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-ottawa-senators-game-17-preview-projected-lines-tv-info-2/,McCabe on the return of Connor Dewar to the lineup:,I was pumped to see Dewey out there at practice yesterday. It has been a long road for him. I have also had shoulder surgery in my career. I know what it is like. I am sure getting reps in with theMarlieswas important.  He is chomping at the bit to get back in the lineup here and contribute.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/12/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-ottawa-senators-game-17-preview-projected-lines-tv-info-2/,Craig Berube on the challenge presented by the Senators’ offense:,"They have a lot of firepower. They have a lot of good players. They are maturing as it goes along and are getting better and better. You have Sanderson and Chabot on the backend, who are highly skilled defensemen who can really skate and get up the ice. Up front, we know the guys they have. We can’t give them freebies tonight. We have to make them work for everything. We have to make them earn everything they get. We can’t be giving up odd-man rushes against these guys. We have to check extremely well tonight against this team. That is what it boils down to for me."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/12/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-ottawa-senators-game-17-preview-projected-lines-tv-info-2/,Berube on the expectations for Dewar in his first NHL game since last spring’s playoffs:,"Simplify, right? He went down and played, but it has been a while. He has been practicing with us, so he is familiar with everything. But there is timing and NHL speed in a game. Just simplify and play your game. He is an energy guy who is physical grinding it out and checking. It is the first game back, and it has been a long time for him, so it’s about getting up to speed. It is a fast game out there. He has to make sure he is simplifying and playing smart."

I still feel like I’ve been part of the team since I was a little kid. I take it personally when stuff goes on. I am always in the mix on what is happening between the two teams. It is easy to get up for these games. You know there are going to be a lot of emotions, and the crowd is going to be into it. It’s exciting be a part of."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/25/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-58-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Bobby McMann on the confidence gained from having both Anthony Stolarz and Joseph Woll healthy and rotating in net:,"Huge confidence, knowing every single night, one of those two guys is backstopping us. It helps us, especially at the start of games, if maybe a team is pressing in their home building or whatever it is. Those guys are going to stand up tall for us."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/25/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-58-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,John Tavares on what the team can take away from the last couple of wins in the season series vs. Boston:,"Play a hard game with a lot of emotion, but be very disciplined as well. It is the way you have to execute, the way we have to check, and certainly, the pace and determination you need to have on offense to break them down and get around the net. It is a very good defensive team with very good goaltending. We are very familiar with the challenge, and we want to bring those same things that brought us success in the last couple of matchups."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/25/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-58-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Bruins head coach Joe Sacco on the challenge presented by the Leafs:,"They’ve played well for the majority of the year. They’ve been pretty consistent in their game. They are a strong forechecking team, so we are going to have to execute our breakouts well. We are going to have to be able to handle their pressure. I don’t know where their power play stands in the league off the top of my head, but you don’t want to be in the penalty box much against them. You want to make sure you play a disciplined game. Any time we play Toronto, sometimes, you can throw out a lot of the Xs and Os. It is more about the emotions of the game, the competitiveness, and the sense of urgency."

We know where we are at with the other guys. It is up to us as a group. Everybody has to step up and take on a little bit more. It is a good thing at the end of the day. You get to see and evaluate how players respond when they get more of an opportunity. We have played without [Lindholm] for a while now. We have played without McAvoy at times. We are confident in the group that we have back there. We all have to help out, though. We need everybody right now. It is incumbent upon our whole group to do our job out there and make it easier on everyone."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/25/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-58-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Sacco on his team’s battle for a playoff spot as rumours swirl about management selling off pieces at the trade deadline:,We have a competitive group here. We have some players who have played a lot of playoff hockey in the past. We have goals inside ourselves in terms of how we want to play moving forward. We have a big game — a divisional game — and that is our focus right now. We are one point out of a playoff spot right now. Teams that had games in hand on us have suddenly caught up to us. We need to embrace the situation we are in as far as playing meaningful games right now. We have a group that understands where we are at. We have veteran players who have been around a long time. I have discussions with players all the time. This group is focused on Toronto. We are not looking down the road. We are in a fight right now. It is an opportunity to make up some ground and do something. We haven’t been in this position in a while. These are meaningful games. We are trying to use them as a stepping stone.

They’re a fast team. We need some pace back into our game a little bit more. He can provide that."

I have a lot of memories in this building — and the old building, where I played. There are not many good ones in the old building. It is great. It is a great place, and a great hockey town. I always get pretty jacked up coming into this building."

[Lorentz’s] shot tip versus Tampa was a big, big goal. [OEL’s] play through the whole thing. You have these great memories that you don’t live in every day, and then you get these awesome reminders. You show up to the rink, you love these guys, and you are happy for them. You wish they were here, but you understand why they’re not. You get these nice little reminders of a very special time in your life."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-florida-panthers-game-22-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Maurice on whether he’s surprised by Anthony Stolarz’s success in Toronto:,"No. He plays exactly like he played for us. Exactly. That’s him. He played on maybe some tough teams. I am not being disrespectful to the teams he played for, but they were in different parts of their programs. The Florida program and Toronto program are pretty solid. We are going to play a pretty good game in front of you. I think (Panthers goalie coach) Robb Tallas is fantastic at what he does. He can find what a player is great at and maximize that. It was good for him to work with Sergei (Bobrovsky) and watch Sergei’s program. They had a wonderful relationship. He was incredibly consistent with his game. He didn’t work in a lot of off nights. Our schedule wasn’t as compressed last year. We would’ve played him far more, but our priority #1 was rhythm for Bobrovsky. If he was in our schedule this year, we have 14 sets of back-to-back games. Those are 14 before you even get out of the gate. We are probably going to throw another 15 on top of that just based on his play. I am not surprised. I don’t think he was lucky with us. He worked his ass off. He understands his game. He has a really good team in front of him. It is almost his first chance to show how good he is."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-florida-panthers-game-22-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Maurice on Oliver Ekman-Larsson’s understated physicality:,"When you play in the #1 hole as he did his entire career, there are times when you conserve a little bit. You can’t be running around finishing every check. It is not a really big part of your game. He is playing two minutes on the top power play and playing against the other team’s best from game to game. With us, he started in the top four because of injuries. He played with [Kulikov] at the end, and Kuli is a physical player. You also then play against more physical players — the third and fourth lines of other teams — so that is the way the game is played. He had no problem playing the game like that. He was a hell of a defenseman before he got hurt. He is a hell of a defenseman now. He just had to get healthy and play."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-florida-panthers-game-22-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Maurice on his team’s first 22 games:,"What we thought we’d be good at, we’ve been good at. What we’ve struggled with, we’ve probably struggled a little more with. We are not as strong defensively from our net to our forwards as I would like us to be. Our numbers were pretty good by the end of the year as we worked towards that. We are probably scoring a little more than I thought we might. I am not getting too particularly excited about that because it ebbs and flows. Favourite word in coaching is potential. We have the potential to get better."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-florida-panthers-game-22-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Maurice on theMaple Leafsunder Craig Berube:,"I don’t watch them play enough. I know it is heresy up there, but if they are not involved in one of our prescouts… Depending on the schedule we have or the weight of the game, I’ll go back and watch their last game or two, or I’ll go back and pick a team that plays like us from a systems point of view. We have a really good pre-scout guy, and he is going to give me about 80 clips of the Leafs. I am going to sit through them. What we’ll learn will be tonight on the ice. Every coach has an affinity for a certain style of game and systems. While the Maple Leafs look slightly different than the St. Louis Blues, that is more personnel-based. The structure of what they’re trying to do and how they are going to play the game is very, very similar."

We just go out and focus on playing our game: get our forecheck going and be physical. We want to initiate as much as possible tonight.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-florida-panthers-game-22-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on his level of respect for the Panthers’ recent accomplishments:,"For a team to win a Stanley Cup, you have to get some bounces to go your way. There is a little luck involved, but you make your own luck by playing your game. I think Florida does that extremely well. They have an identity, and they play to it. That didn’t change throughout the playoffs. They played a certain way night in and night out. It is a hard, heavy game. You have to respect that."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-florida-panthers-game-22-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Steven Lorentz’s tips for scoring on friend Sergei Bobrovsky:,"Don’t shoot at his chest. Don’t shoot anywhere, really. Great goalie. Better human being. I got to know him last year and would warm him up. It was just a little thing, but when I was in the lineup, with that little part I could contribute, he made me feel like I was the world to him. It is a little bond that you can’t duplicate. It is something that we formed over time. Going right to the Finals, there were little tricks and tips he would show me. I am not going to share those. Hopefully, I can use them against him. Maybe he was low-key telling me, knowing I was going to one day shoot against him, and he was going to flash the leather or something. He is a great guy and a great goalie. It is going to be a good test. We are going to have get a lot of pucks to the net, and we are going to have to get some bounces."

A lot of emotions, to be honest with you, coming into the room, seeing the guys, and going through your head what you went through last year with the battles with the group. A lot of emotions, but also, a lot of fun."

It is more direct. They want to be a forechecking team. They want to put you under duress to cause turnovers to cause scoring chances. That is Chief."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/26/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-9-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on Philippe Myers making his season/Leafs debut:,"He came into camp and earned a spot. He played physical. He was good on the penalty kill. He defended very well back there. He is a big guy. It is a simple game, but he is hard to play against. He killed well for us in preseason."

I threw him in there for one game, but it is hard with just one game. He has to be patient right now. It is just the way it is. We make a decision as a staff and an organization about what we feel is best at the time. He is working on his game. He will get another opportunity."

We had a good practice on Friday. It is not the way we wanted to play in front of the hometown against St. Louis, Chief’s old team. It was not a great game in Columbus, either, but you’re going to have those games. It is a good chance to go out and put a good foot forward against a division rival. It is two teams who don’t like each other. We are going to have to make sure we get up for this one."

It is a long season. You can’t hit the panic button eight games into the season. A lot is going to happen. It is a new system. It takes time for guys to adjust. We are going through that right now. We know what we have to do. We just have to do things harder and a little bit faster. If we do that, we’ll be okay."

You correct things with video and talks, and then you work on things in practice. The spirit and energy were good in practice. The guys are ready to go tonight. They are disappointed, too. That is the way it is. Players aren’t happy when they’re not winning or playing well. They understand that."

We’re trying to find the right balance on lines, and it’s an opportunity for him. He’s playing against the Toronto Maple Leafs. He’s from just outside Toronto. It’s a great opportunity. Everybody who knows him — who has ever been associated with him since he was seven years old in hockey — is going to be watching him play against the Maple Leafs. That’s a great opportunity for him."

We have to play our game, as we did last night. We have to be physical, have good structure, and play good defense. [Dean Evason’s] teams play hard and come at you hard. It is what we see in the tape. They are very aggressive. They are going to come at us and take away time and space. They are playing hard."

We didn’t have a very productive night offensively the other night (vs. Minnesota). We thought we did some real good things defensively. We gave up the 5-on-3 to make it 2-1, but we thought we limited them pretty well. We are looking after our defensive zone, but we have to try to find some way to score some goals. We are moving some stuff around to get some balance, and hopefully, we can generate some more offense because of it."

He has been great in camp. His work ethic has been unbelievable. He is hounding pucks and on pucks. He is strong on it. He just has to do that tonight in a game. He doesn’t have to complicate the game. Use his speed, play in straight lines, and be responsible defensively."

I moved him around the lineup. I wanted to see him with different players. He got a little power-play time and maybe a little bit of penalty kill. He did some good things. He is a very good player. There are a couple of situations where he maybe could’ve made a different decision with the puck than he did, but overall, I was pretty pleased with his effort and what he did in the game."

I felt that we got better as the game went on. I got more confident in my game. I felt like I just kept it simple. I’d like to bring a bit more confidence and carry the puck a bit more. I had a bit more space than I thought out there. I’m just getting adjusted to the speed, and it will be easier to adjust tonight with the last game under my belt. I am excited for tonight."

We are getting back into it. Our defensive structure wasn’t too sound. We allowed a lot of slip plays into the middle, which isn’t good enough by us. We are trying to clean our defensive zone up and keep our offense hot. We scored a lot of goals and created some good opportunities — we want to keep that up — but we want to be better defensively."

They’re a good team with a lot of talent and play with strong structure. They have their top players who are always going to be dangerous to defend, and you have to be aware of those guys, but the team in general is strong, competitive, and plays with structure. Anytime time you get that combined with some of the high-end talent, it is a challenge."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/29/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-minnesota-wild-game-51-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Hynes on the threat posed by William Nylander:,"He is so dangerous. He’s a really competitive player, and add on top of that the skill and vision, and he is a guy who can hurt you in so many different ways. He has great poise with the puck and can make plays — plays where you think you have things locked up and he makes a great play. He is a shooting threat. He is a passing threat. Even when we played in Minnesota, he was just as dangerous. He is playing really well this year. He will be a challenge, among others, on the team."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/29/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-minnesota-wild-game-51-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Hynes on the challenge of matching up against Chris Tanev:,"He is a difficult guy to play against. He defends hard. He has good size. He is physical. He blocks shots. He is a guy who is usually matched up against top guys. As much as you are aware of some of the offensive things the team does, a guy like Tanev is going to be tough to play against in his own right."

The good thing for us is that we know who we are as a team and what we are as a team regardless of who is in the lineup. That is the way we need to continue to approach it as we go down the stretch. Kirill is a superstar player with elite skill and sense, but he is a team guy. He plays to our team identity. The thing you miss with a guy like him are the plays he sees that other guys don’t see with the high level of talent and skill that he has. You miss that type of chance generation — the pure talent of the player — but from a team perspective, we want to continue to play to the identity that we feel will give us the best chance to win on both sides of the puck."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/29/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-minnesota-wild-game-51-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Hynes on his team’s strength on the road this season:,"The mindset we play with has been strong. We have a close-knit group. We clearly understand the identity we need to play with. On the road, we have been very committed to that. We’ve been ready to start games. I think we make good decisions to set our game up and give ourselves the best chance to win."

I think that’s good."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/29/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-minnesota-wild-game-51-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Bobby McMann on Tanev’s voice in the room:,"He is maybe not so much a rah-rah type, but he is always seeing the game from the defensive side of it — what the forwards can do better, and where we can be. He is definitely vocal in bringing those sorts of things up, and strategically, how we can get pucks into the zone easier."

They always know what is happening. Coming back to the bench, there are little things here or there. “Call for the puck there,” or, “Try to open up there,” or, “Trust that we’ll get the puck.” That is the biggest thing I’ve learned: I don’t need to always go and support them all the time. They are exceptional players and can make plays in tight spaces. It is about finding the open ice, I think."

Hopefully, it ends up drawing more penalties, too. The more you are a threat, the more likely someone is going to take a penalty on you, or you’ll get a chance there. That’s the most important thing: get to the front of the net and get to the middle of the ice."

They play a well-structured game in all three zones. It is about being patient, sticking to our game, and trusting that we’ll put pucks behind them, go to work, and compete. Hopefully, we can wear them down to the point where we come out on top at the end."

Find rebounds. Looking at it over the last day or so and this morning, we have to attack, shoot pucks, and get into the paint area. That is how you take advantage of it — that includes five-on-five, too."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-florida-panthers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-4/,Sheldon Keefe on what type of game he is expecting given the circumstances for both teams:,"I don’t know. We will see. They’re playing for something that is not totally in their hands. It is still game #81. Both teams know they are playing for something bigger that is coming. I am not concerned about their group. I am concerned about ours and wanting to make sure we play with good habits, good structure, and all of the things we’ve been talking about wanting to tighten up. As much as it is difficult to find meaning in the game, you want to tighten up your details and make that the purpose of it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-florida-panthers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-4/,Keefe on how he might manage the minutes of his top players:,"Relatively normal in terms of playing to win the game. You’d like to see it closer to where it has been over the last few weeks rather than where it was the other night. But we are going to play the game, too. Any time you put your gear on, you are playing to win the game and respond accordingly. You hope you don’t have to stress your guys too much."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-florida-panthers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-4/,Ryan Reaves on facing a potential round-one opponent in game #81:,These last couple of games should set the tone for our team. We are playing a team we might play in the playoffs. You have to set the tone for that series. I know they are going to try to do the same in their barn. We have to match that. We have to outdo that.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-florida-panthers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-4/,Paul Maurice on the strategy for preventing Auston Matthews from scoring his 70th in Florida:,"It won’t matter because he has almost 70 of them and everyone is geared up to stop him. That has no effect. It is more of a Toronto thing. I would do the exact same thing. At this time of year, with them locked up, he is coming out one out of four at best. But when you are sitting on 69 goals and there is an offensive-zone draw, he is coming back out. And you have to. There is not a rest issue here. We are all getting two or three days off after this game and he is going to be 100% fresh. I hope he gets it. I would prefer it wasn’t tonight, but it is a phenomenal story and such an unusual thing to happen. I would be the same way. We were cheering for Sam Reinhart to get 50. 50 goals is a big deal, and then you get someone closing in on 70… We just want it not to be tonight. We will focus on their elite players the same way we would every game. Hopefully, he’ll get it tomorrow."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-florida-panthers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-4/,Maurice on his lineup decisions for the final regular-season game:,"We’ll play to win. If our team has something on the line, we will dress everybody who is healthy and ready to go, which I like. I’m not a fan of sitting guys out because then you’re a week between games, and I’m not a big fan of that. Everybody plays. Verhaeghe is good to go, so he’s back in the lineup tonight. Ekman-Larsson won’t play; he could, but there was no sense in putting him in. Away we go."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-florida-panthers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-4/,Maurice on whether there is a message-sending opportunity tonight ahead of a possibleLeafsvs. Panthers series:,"I never really believed in that. What happens tonight will have nothing to do with how you come into the first game of the playoffs. Both teams have a healthy respect for the other team. They have also had enough success in games. The games have been exciting and loose this year during the regular season. A little bit more loose than we will see in the playoffs. Because we know each other so well, there is no new wrinkle, secret, or idea. They have great players. We have great players. If we play each other it will be a hell of a series."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-florida-panthers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-4/,Maurice on the return of Carter Verhaeghe to the Panthers’ lineup:,"When Carter went down, our power play went down a little bit. He’s the fixer on it because he can get on a puck from a corner, and he is such a good skater that his puck retrieval is great. When you’re banging around and everybody thinks we’re trying to get it to Reinhart, Verhaeghe gets it in an unusual spot, and it’s bar down and in. It is one or two when you need it for your power play to stay hot. He has kind of been the fixer for our power play. This is fairly close to our (full) forward group. It doesn’t feel like we’ve had that since Calgary five weeks ago. I don’t feel like we have had our group together once. We will get fairly close to it. Ekblad will definitely be ready for Game 1, and Ekman-Larsson will be back in. Other than the things we can’t control regarding tonight’s game and the practices this week, we should be pretty healthy."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-florida-panthers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-4/,Sheldon Keefe on the team’s superior form on the road compared to home:,"It is difficult to pinpoint why it is. We just know it is a thing. We have performed well. I think our mindset has been good on the road and maybe not as good at home. Maybe there are different reasons for that. I don’t know what you would really be able to grab onto there. I do know we are confident that we can have success wherever we play if we get to our game. We seem to have been able to get to our game more consistently on the road this season. To that end, wherever the games may be played, we will be confident going in, just knowing that we will have to have our game in order no matter what building we’re in."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-florida-panthers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-4/,John Tavares on the team’s strength on the road this season:,"We really like how our game has been really poised no matter the situation or scenario on the road. We have handled it very well. Whether momentum is going our way or against us, our ability to stay with it, grab the game back, and grab momentum… Whatever the game has called for, we have responded to whatever is required."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/14/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-dallas-stars-game-45-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the challenge presented by the Dallas Stars:,Very good team. Very deep team. They don’t give a whole lot up. They are solid all around. The goaltending is good. Heiskanen and Harley on the backend are very good skaters and transporters of the puck. They are a tough opponent.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/14/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-dallas-stars-game-45-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Chris Tanev on the challenge presented by his former team:,"They play with a lot of pace and move pucks very quickly. Five guys connected, moving pucks, and getting pucks up the ice. They obviously want to play in our end than a lot more than in their own. We’ve only played one game against them, and they probably should’ve beat us, but our goalie was really good. It was a good game in Dallas, but in the first half of the game, they sort of controlled a lot of the play. We were definitely able to create some chances offensively, but we gave up a little more than we wanted to."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/14/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-dallas-stars-game-45-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Tanev on the most under-recognized players in Dallas:,"Probably Thomas Harley. Incredible player. Great skater. Moves the puck really well. Great offensive instincts, but works just as hard defensively. He is the real deal for a really young player. He probably doesn’t get talked about enough — he and Esa (Lindell).  Esa is an incredible defenseman — great stick, makes the right play all the time, big, and strong. Those two guys are extremely good defensemen who definitely don’t get enough recognition."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/14/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-dallas-stars-game-45-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Peter DeBoer on theLeafs‘ seven straight wins over the Stars:,"They seem to have our number here in Dallas. Number one, our Robertson has to outplay their Robertson for the first time. That message is going to be delivered clearly here to Jason for us. We have to start there. I am joking, but bigger than that, we have to play a really good game against them. If you are off in one area — your special teams are off, or your goaltending is off, or the detail in the five-on-five game is off — they have too good of a team. They will make you pay. We have to put it all together tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/14/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-dallas-stars-game-45-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,DeBoer on Steven Lorentz joining a line with Auston Matthews and Mitch Marner:,"Those two guys drive the line. I am happy for Lorentz — good Waterloo-Kitchener boy who has had a really great journey through hockey. I like to see that. I like it when coaches reward guys like that for effort. I don’t think it hurts the big players to get some of that directness and physicality in their game. We do that once in a while here, too. A lot of the times it sparks your big guys."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/14/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-dallas-stars-game-45-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,DeBoer on starting goaltender Jake Oettinger’s 0-3-0 record against theLeafs:,He is a proud guy. He knows what is at stake. He has been playing really good hockey for us. You don’t get a bigger stage than in Toronto. I am sure you will see a good game out of him.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/14/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-dallas-stars-game-45-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,DeBoer on Chris Tanev:,"I loved the guy. What you see is what you get every night. He never wavers. He knows what his game is and brings it to the rink every night. He played through some really significant injuries with us in the playoffs. He was really compromised, and you’d never know it. There were some days when he could barely get his skates on, and he found a way to get out there and help us in a deep playoff run. Just a warrior."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/14/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-dallas-stars-game-45-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,DeBoer on Jani Hakanpaa’s game when healthy:,"He is the same. That was a really good signing by them in the summer if he is healthy. If he is healthy, he is a big guy who is physical and ends plays. Good penalty killer. Really good man. Good in the dressing room. The only question is his health, but if he is healthy, he can be a really, really good player for them, particularly in the playoffs. He gave us some great minutes during my time there."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/14/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-dallas-stars-game-45-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the expectations for his team tonight after a couple of losses in a row:,"Just a more complete game. In the last game, I think we were pretty solid defensively, but we didn’t create enough offensively — power play included. We need to put it all together tonight. At the same time, they are a stingy team. You have to take what they give you. We can’t open it up. We don’t want to play that way, either. We just want to play a real solid hockey game for 60 minutes tonight. We need everybody. We can’t have any passengers tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/14/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-dallas-stars-game-45-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the expectation for Lorentz on the Matthews-Marner line:,"Just bring energy to the line, more than anything — size, compete, and a pretty simple game. He is going to be at the net. He is going to forecheck for them. He is going to get in there and create loose pucks. It’s just adding a little bit of energy to that line."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/14/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-dallas-stars-game-45-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,"Berube on the message to Lorentz, who admitted he was nervous to play with Matthews and Marner:","Keep it simple. He doesn’t need to change his game. He just needs to do what he does. Matthews and Marner will do what they do. I don’t think he needs to force pucks or try to find them. Just keep playing your game and do your thing. He’s a meat-and-potatoes guy who is going to go to the net, hound pucks, and create loose-puck battles for those guys. Sometimes, when you put a worker with two skilled players, they need that."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/14/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-dallas-stars-game-45-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Lorentz on whether he has experienced a similar opportunity up the lineup in the league before:,"There were some times in Carolina when someone would go down, and I would play with Sebastian Aho or Andrei Svechnikov. They are easy guys to play with. As good as they are — world-class talent — they are hard workers, too. As long as you are working hard and are on the same page with a similar mindset, good things will happen. It is a good challenge. Not every day do you get to play with two of the top players in the world. It’s exciting."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Sheldon Keefe on whether he wants his team to remember the 6-3 loss to New Jersey from late March:,"I certainly want them to remember it. It is not necessarily specific to New Jersey, but more about how we want to play as a team. We have done a good job of that since then. We have done a good job, for the most part, up until that point. It is just a reminder that when we don’t take care of the puck and make it easy for the opposition to get to our net, it makes it easy to win. This team certainly has the skill and ability to counter-punch. It is really more about us having a disciplined approach to our game."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Keefe on giving Samsonov the night off:,"We had a plan for Sammy that we were not going to have him make the trip to save him the travel and have a nothing day. We felt Jones could back up for us. It just made sense. Sammy will take the day off, and we will have a team day off. Sammy will get a little bit of work done with Curtis, but really, it is about managing and benefitting from three goalies."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Keefe on Joseph Woll battling inconsistency since his return from injury:,"I am not certain inconsistency is the right word. He is a young goalie who doesn’t have a lot of experience in the league, and he missed a long period of time coming back from injury. Finding a groove has been difficult. The challenge for him has been taking each day and game as they come. It is a challenge and an opportunity for him tonight to go in, trust his skill, and for the team to do a better job in front of him — certainly, a better job than the last time against these guys."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,TJ Brodie on the lesson from the recent defeat to New Jersey:,"We have been playing well, especially defensively, with being patient and not forcing things when we are not putting the puck in the net. If it takes a full 60, it takes a full 60."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Travis Green on the lessons from the last game against Toronto:,They’re good [laughs]. They make a lot of plays. They move the puck well. They pass it well and skate well. We have to be ready for their speed and skill. They are going to be a determined group. They have a lot to play for right now.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/09/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Green on the challenge against Auston Matthews:,"He is one of the best players in the world. He has a great release and a great shot with a great nose for the net. It is not just his play with the puck. He has become a really good two-way player as well. When people talk about you in the manner of one of the best players in the world, there is a long list of what you’re good at… He is a big centerman who controls the game in many ways. Usually, guys who score that many goals are pure goal scorers. It is well known that he brings a lot of other things."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/03/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Jon Cooper on Auston Matthews’ 70-goal chase:,"I have had the privilege of not only being behind the bench back when he was playing in 2016, but I have a 13-year-old son, and he is one of the guys where you go, “That is how you can shoot a puck,” or, “That is how you can shoot it from your ankles.” He is gifted. On top of that, he is a hell of a guy. I like watching that guy play. Hopefully, for 60 minutes tonight, he doesn’t do the things he does most of the time he plays this game. He is a player. Alex Ovechkin, in our generation, has been the guy. When you pair the numbers up of Auston and Ovi, you were thinking Ovi was untouchable, but Auston is pretty much not only touching him but has done better than he has at certain times. We are talking about the elite of the elite and some of the most gifted ever to play the game. He is not a kid anymore. He has done it for quite some time. It is very impressive."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/03/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Cooper on his team turning it on in the last month as they look to secure a playoff spot:,"It is kind of weird that last year, at Christmas, we knew we were playing the Leafs. This year, at Christmas, we knew we weren’t playing the Leafs. It has been one of those years. I don’t know what our point total was a year ago today, but we are not too far off. But we got to this point in a different way. A playoff spot is a playoff spot. Right now, it is ours to lose. It would be shame on us if we don’t get in. But these guys, in the month of March, have put us in a spot where, on March 1, we were maybe thinking it wasn’t going to be like this. I am proud of the guys for what they have done. Every year is different. We just played that outdoor game two years ago in Nashville. There is a team picture. Out of the 23 guys, there are only eight guys left. It was two years ago. There is a good core here, but there are a lot of new guys. Sometimes it takes a little time for the guys to mesh. What I do know: When it got time to get going, these guys have kicked it in. We still have work left, but I like what they have done in the past month."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/03/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Sheldon Keefe on the importance of home-ice advantage in the playoffs:,"It is more focusing on your team and getting prepared. You see where chips fall. We were in this situation last season as well. It was pretty similar. I don’t think we saw it as much of anything to look at or aspire to a few weeks ago. It was not even within reach, but things have evened out a little bit. I don’t think it changes our mindset. We have been good in both places. We have had home ice in the past. It is really about who is most prepared to play and who has their game in order when the time comes. Wherever the games are played, we will be ready."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/03/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Morgan Rielly on his return to the lineup:,"It feels good. You just want to come back and help the team and pick up where you left off. It’s not always easy coming back, but it hasn’t been that long, so I don’t expect any issues."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/03/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Rielly on the challenge the Lightning present:,"They’re a good team. They’re deep. I mean, we know them well from the last couple seasons, so I think we know what to expect in terms of their speed, their skill, and they’re very competitive. They’ve got a couple guys that are having an outstanding season, so you know we’ll be ready to go tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/12/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-anaheim-ducks-game-29-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the return of Jake McCabe to the lineup:,"He is a big part of our team back there; he and Tanev are our shutdown pair and penalty-killing (pair), with physical play and defending. A big part of our team, and it is great to have him back. They think alike and are on the same page. They are similar players in how they play the game and how they think the game."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/12/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-anaheim-ducks-game-29-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the keys to spending less time in the defensive zone:,"Killing plays quicker and exiting the zone quicker. When we kill plays and get the puck, where are our outs? Let’s get going. Let’s transition from defense to offense. We have to be better at that."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/12/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-anaheim-ducks-game-29-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the decision to stick with Anthony Stolarz in net tonight:,"There is the back-to-back (this weekend), too, but Stoly played one hell of a game (in New Jersey). We all know that. That was the call to go back with him."

He has a really good skill set with the plays he can make breaking out of our end and whatnot, but the commitment he makes physically every night and the emotional investment he has is massive on the ice and in the locker room. He plays a lot against the other team’s top players and loves that challenge of being difficult to play against and trying to keep them off the scoresheet. He brings a lot for us."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/12/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-anaheim-ducks-game-29-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Tavares on the areas for improvement after the OT win in New Jersey:,"Most parts of our game. We weren’t very good. We want to respond with a much better effort and be a lot more like ourselves with the type of pace we can play with coming out our own end and how difficult we can be on the forecheck, sustaining the forecheck, and wearing teams down."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/12/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-anaheim-ducks-game-29-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Jake McCabe on his health situation over the past week and a half:,"I am feeling a lot better now than I was last week. I didn’t quite feel right or feel comfortable putting myself in a situation to play. The medical staff takes great care of us. I got the go-ahead now, so I am ready to get back at it. Any time you take a puck to the head, you want to be extra careful and make sure you are crossing all of your T’s and dotting all of your I’s. That is what we did."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/12/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-anaheim-ducks-game-29-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,McCabe on the success of his partnership with Chris Tanev:,"It is just our mentality. We go over the boards and our job is to keep the puck out of the net, get the puck to our forwards, get the play transitioning, and spend as little time in our defensive zone as possible. [Tanev] does a great job of positioning. He is the most willing player in the league to eat shots from everywhere. We talk well, and I think we have been pretty good with the puck as well. When you are good with the puck, you have to defend less. It has been going well so far. I am excited to get back out there with him tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/12/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-anaheim-ducks-game-29-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,McCabe on new Duck Jacob Trouba’s game:,"I’ve known Troubs for 15 or 16 years. We go back to the U18 World Championships team together. He came up and played with our team as a ’94. Even back then, he played a similar game to what he does now. He plays hard. He can throw the body around. He shoots the puck hard. He’s a leader. It’s a new start for him in Anaheim."

They fired 17 shots on goal in the third period, and Washington head coach Spencer Carbery was disgusted by his team’s effort with the lead:","Carbery: “The second half of the game was not good enough. Embarrassing, for that matter. Just embarrassing, flat out… Playing a team on a back-to-back, in a third period with the way it looked with a two-goal lead… Embarrassing on home ice.”"

We know how well Toronto has played of late. It is a good chance for us to get our game back in order after the San Jose game, playing against a real good team in their building. A lot of guys have ties to the area. It is a good opportunity for our group."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/06/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-game-26-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Carbery on whether the loss to Toronto in mid-November serves as extra motivation for the Capitals tonight:,"We talked a little bit about it this morning, but it is more from a standpoint of what we failed to do in the third period and how we got away from our game, which ended up costing us the hockey game. It was more from an Xs and Os tactical standpoint of what we got away from, and for that matter, what this team does really well to give you issues, as they did at the end of that game. Hopefully, we will be able to handle that a little bit better tonight and learn from the experience against them in our building."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/06/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-game-26-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Carbery on Mitch Marner and Auston Matthews re-uniting for tonight’s game:,"When I watch, whether it is JT with Mitch, JT with Willy… To me, that is all just the ebbs and flows of a season. In my time here, it happened. Guys get moved around. It gets stale. You move it, and then it goes back. They are just very, very elite players. When Mitch and Auston are playing together or Johnny and Willy, there is chemistry because they have played together for a long time. They can make a ton of plays in the offensive zone and off the rush. You have to be ready. In my time here, I always appreciated that [Sheldon Keefe] would do a pretty good job of getting Willy, Auston, and Mitch on the ice at the same time three or four times a game. That wasn’t any genius plan that Keefer had. You have three really good players, so get them out on the ice. You can look like a really good coach doing that. We also have to know that in the third period (last game), they had a huge period together, so that chemistry is going to be back, and they are feeling really good about themselves going into tonight."

I thought we had several players who had strong arguments and cases to be a part of the tournament and represent their countries. I understand my opinion is a little bit biased, but it is one thing if you are advocating for your players and sitting at .500. We are sitting at the top of the Eastern Conference standings right now, and to not have one guy there is a little odd to me, especially with some of the seasons guys are having. They scout it so heavily, and they look into the numbers. Why have the Capitals had so much success this season? There are a lot of players we have who have strong cases. I also have to take it with a grain of salt. The people who are making these decisions aren’t working with these players every day. I have worked with these players every single day for the last two years and watched them lay it on the line with how intelligent they are and how they play in tight games. When you tell me it’s a best-on-best tournament, I am going with Tom Wilson all day long. I have seen it. I have seen what he can do in a 1-1 game when our season is on the line. It is a little bit unfair and biased for me, but I felt like guys had real good starts to the year and deserved an opportunity. But I also understand they are difficult decisions when you get to the bubble of those teams."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/06/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-game-26-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,"Carbery on whether the 4 Nations snubs add motivation for the players, especially as the team plays in the spotlight in Toronto tonight:","Maybe, but I feel like our group has been pretty fueled from the offseason and summer. There were not a lot of people in the hockey world who picked the Washington Capitals to be sitting where they are. If you look at it individually, John Carlson is still playing at an elite level. You can make strong arguments that he is playing as good as he has in the last 10 years when you look under the hood and at the numbers. There is the season Dylan Strome is having, and [Wilson] and Logan Thompson. Rasmus Sandin has taken a huge step this year. I feel like our group is very self-motivated. They want to be the best and they want to win. Playing in Toronto is the biggest hockey market in the world, and we have a lot of guys from that area. Playing in front of friends and family is always a little added (juice). But I just feel like they are already highly, highly motivated."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/06/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-game-26-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the challenge presented by the Capitals:,"They are a very good team. They score a lot. They’re a good rush team. They are a big, heavy team, in my opinion. They are going to forecheck hard, and they are good on the rush. We had our hands full [in Washington] for that game. I don’t expect anything different. I know Ovechkin played that game, but they are still playing really good hockey without him."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/06/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-game-26-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the decision to start Matthews-Marner together tonight:,"With the way it ended up last game, I think we start that way tonight. Sometimes, you change things up in games and it works, so you stick with it and see how it goes."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/06/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-game-26-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,John Tavares on not making the Team Canada 4 Nations roster:,"It is disappointing. I would have loved to have been a part of it. Playing in best-on-best tournaments internationally and playing for the Stanley Cup are the pinnacles of our sport. Having the opportunity to compete in those events is really special and unique. Obviously, I am disappointed, but I just get back focused on what we are doing day-to-day here with the club. I have to do my best to continue to play well. It is a long grind of a season, and I’ll continue to focus on that. The news has come out, and things are official. We just move on from there."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/06/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-game-26-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Tavares on whether the 4 Nations snub serves as extra motivation:,"Naturally, you are disappointed and motivated to play well. I am always that way, but in general, you just want to continue to push to be part of events and opportunities like that to play for Team Canada. There are the Olympics next year and whatever happens after that. It is not what you really focus on, but if you play at a high level and show that you can be part of a winning group, you put yourself in that mix. Hopefully, those opportunities will still be there down the road. Motivation-wise, it is always the same. I need to prove myself every day and work to be at my best to help the Leafs here and do everything we can to win."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-los-angeles-kings-game-4-projected-lines-tv-info/,"The response to such a circus game—especially from a team with a strong defensive reputation like the Kings—is often a recommitment to discipline and defensive details. Add in the large contingent of Ontario-born players in the lineup for the visitors (five, even without Drew Doughty in the lineup), and theLeafswill need to be prepared for a motivated LA team tonight. Kings head coach Jim Hiller went ahead and provided some bulletin board material before the game:","“Of course, we are missing Drew. Drew loved to play in Toronto. He would bring everybody in from London. He is encouraging the guys and letting them know that you don’t lose when you come into Toronto.”"
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-los-angeles-kings-game-4-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the challenge presented by the Kings:,"They are heavy. Big team. Strong down low in the offensive zone. They play a different syle than they have in the past. They are a lot more on the go now. They have some very good players over there, led by the leader, Kopitar. Fiala is dangerous. They are good on the power play; they scored three the other night against Ottawa. We have to be disciplined. Big, heavy team. Any time you play the Kings — and this has been the case for years now — it is going to be a battle. We have to win the battles. We have to be strong at our net front. Puck battles are important tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-los-angeles-kings-game-4-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on Max Domi’s ability at the center position:,"He was moving really well. He moves a lot better in the middle, I would say, in terms of moving his feet. He is a very good playmaker, so when he gets open ice and has some speed, he can really skate. He is dangerous. He can make plays. In saying, he should shoot more. He had a couple of opportunities, and he passed up on some shots. We are trying to get him to shot a little bit more on his opportunities."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-los-angeles-kings-game-4-projected-lines-tv-info/,Max Domi on his versatility to shift around from wing to center:,"Whatever position any of us are asked to play, you step in and do it to the best of your ability. That has been the story. I don’t mind whether it is left wing, center, or right wing. I am equally as comfortable with all three of them."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-los-angeles-kings-game-4-projected-lines-tv-info/,Domi on Nick Robertson’s start to the season:,"We played together a lot last year. He has been around for a while. For the amount of talent he has, he is a guy you could see scoring 30 goals every year. You watch him in practice, and other than maybe Auston and Willy, he is right behind them in terms of, “He doesn’t miss.” Those guys don’t miss, either, but Nick is right behind them. He is doing a lot of the other things that come with being an NHL player consistently, night in and night out. He is backchecking like crazy. He works super hard, which he always has. His defensive stuff is coming along, too. He looks great. I’ve always loved playing with Nick. He has a lot of confidence right now. It is great to see."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-los-angeles-kings-game-4-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the expectation for Timothy Liljegren in his season debut:,"He has ability with his skating and when moving the puck. He should be a good puck mover. It is just about him managing his game, managing his puck movement, and making good decisions with it — not risky ones. Just simplify. And then you have to win your battles, right? As a defenseman, it is important that you are defending well, are strong at your net front, and are winning those board and corner battles. He has to do that."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-los-angeles-kings-game-4-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on what he’s learned about Anthony Stolarz’s game:,"I have known him for a while. I had him in Philly. This year, he is calm and cool in net. He is making the saves he is supposed to. He looks comfortable in net and is tracking pucks well. We are doing a good job in front of him, too, and we need to. It is kind of a combination. It works both ways with a goalie and how you are defending in front of him."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/06/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-buffalo-sabres-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Sabres head coach Don Granato on whether his team gets up for these games vs. the Leafs more than most:,"I would say that if there is an X factor. This an exciting building to come to. You know it is a challenging building. It is one heck of a hockey team over there that you have to be ready for. I do feel that is a bit of the juice. The players know in the preparation phase that they have to bring it. Sometimes it provides enough of a nudge to perform at a higher level or a more effective and efficient level. I think you always know you have to play as a group of five. You have some serious, high-end skill over there that is dangerous. Respecting that forces the need to play well as a group of five for your goaltender. When we have had success, it has been driven by that: playing as a group of five against their talent."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/06/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-buffalo-sabres-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Granato on whether he saw a 70-goal level of upside in Auston Matthews back with the U.S. National Development Team program:,"You absolutely saw the potential. He has had the drive and the appetite, but you saw this at the age of 15. On day one, you get all of the kids into the program. They are the best kids from across the country. When you get them head-to-head, you see who rises. He rose immediately in the first days and weeks to separate himself at that point. You knew he was a special player. Obviously, the biggest attribute is his ability to score goals. It was evident then. I am not very surprised at what he is able to do. He was very impressive at that age."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/06/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-buffalo-sabres-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Granato on Matthews’ ability to add more and more layers to his goal-coring repertoire:,"Great goal scorers have an immense appetite to score. They don’t need to go through three guys to do it. They are willing to shoot through three guys to do it. They are always hungry for the next goal and the next way to score a goal. That is Auston, that is Ovechkin, and that is all of these guys who are great goal-scorers. They are constantly looking for different ways to add goals to their resume. Whether it is from their goal line, behind the net, or anywhere, they just have an appetite to score and score now. They don’t really care to go through another layer of defense. They see how they can score in any situation. Most players, if it is not them vs. the goalie, they don’t think about scoring. They think they have to work their way through the next layer of defense before they can think about scoring. The goal scorers get the puck on their stick and believe they can score from anywhere and in any situation, and they are intuitive enough to figure out how to make it happen."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/06/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-buffalo-sabres-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Sheldon Keefe on David Kampf’s status for tonight:,He’s going be a game time decision. He’s feeling better today. It looks like we’re going through it again here with some of these illnesses. We’ve got some others who will be game time decisions tonight.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/06/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-buffalo-sabres-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Keefe on the motivation of the group coming off the 9-3 loss against the Sabres:,"It less about the motivating or whatever. I don’t think you are focused on that. We are in a much better place as a team than when we were then. But it gets your attention. That is what it is about. We have given up 15 goals against this team in two games. It is one of the most skilled teams in this league. If you don’t defend and don’t take care of the puck — and you make it easy on them — they make you look bad. It is not just us. It is teams across the league. When they are at their best and the game goes their way, that is what they do. We have to respect it with how we play. We have to adapt and be aware of the style of game. It is a different type of game than when you play against them with the skill they have. The game tends to be wide open. We have to manage that."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/06/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-buffalo-sabres-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Keefe on Buffalo bringing their best against the Leafs:,"I don’t think it is any surprise for anyone who is here that we get teams’ best when they come to Toronto when it is a rival like that. When we go in there, we fill their building with our fans. There are lots of reasons for them to be at their best. There are lots of reasons for us to be at our best as well."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/06/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-buffalo-sabres-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Keefe on the encouraging aspects of Ilya Samsonov’s recent play:,"Just the confidence and swagger that he’s got. That is a big part of his game. He has been building on that even though he has been through some tough times here. He has found his way through it. He has done the work. He is just feeling good in that sense. As I was talking about, we are in a different place now than when we played these guys last. I would say the same about Sammy. It has been good to see that growth through the season. We get a chance to put it on display tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/06/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-buffalo-sabres-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Simon Benoit on the lessons from the game against Boston:,"It’s just a question of staying in the present moment. Bad games happen, but you just don’t want them to slide to three or four games in a row. Just learn from your mistakes and keep moving on and focusing on today’s game. There’s nothing we can do about the past… Today’s a big game, we want to come out hard and get those two points."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-buffalo-sabres-game-33-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Morgan Rielly on the challenge he expects from the Sabres tonight:,"When a team is desperate, they are dangerous. They are trying to find their game and get going. It is on us to be prepared for a team that is going to come hard. We expect them to play extremely hard, be extremely structured, and be very competitive. We’ll be ready to go."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-buffalo-sabres-game-33-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Mitch Marner on the split-crowd atmosphere inside the KeyBank Center:,"It’s a really cool moment. It really is. I also think we get more fans especially when the Bills are playing at home on Sunday. A lot of Toronto people and Ontario people are fans of the Bills as well, so they come for the 2-for-1. It is always fun to play in this building in front of both fan bases that get really loud at each other."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-buffalo-sabres-game-33-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the need not to underestimate the Sabres:,"It is going to be a hard game. You can look at the (6-1) Montreal score all you want, and Montreal scored some power play goals on them, but they played extremely hard against Montreal. They were pretty good in that game, to be honest with you. They have Dahlin back tonight. He is a handful. It will be a good atmosphere. It will be a good game and a very competitive game. Our guys have to be ready to go from the drop of the puck. We have to be competitive right away, and we have to play north hockey right away. This is a very good team talent-wise. If you turn pucks over and you are not checking properly, they can do some damage."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-buffalo-sabres-game-33-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on Matt Murray fighting his way back from a major surgery to return to the NHL:,"He is a dedicated guy. He has won two Cups and done it all, but he still has a lot left in the tank. He wants to continue playing. It takes a lot of hard work. It takes a lot of hard work, and he has already accomplished the ultimate goal a couple of times, but he has a lot of fire inside and wants to get back to the form he had once."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-buffalo-sabres-game-33-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Lindy Ruff on the charged atmosphere full ofLeafsfans in Buffalo:,"If we play well, we can take the fans out of the game."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-buffalo-sabres-game-33-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Ruff on meeting with the leaders on the team as the losing slide hits 11 games:,"We met again today, and I said, “It’s you guys — this group of five or six — who I have been around more than the Kulichs and the Bensons and those types of guys. It’s you guys that I’m handing the puck off to. You’re the guys that have to be the difference makers.”"
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-buffalo-sabres-game-33-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Ruff on the return of Rasmus Dahlin to the Sabres’ lineup:,"I think any time you get a player of his caliber back, it’ll be a big boost to the team. First, there is getting pucks out of your end and the speed going back for pucks, and then he’s a difference-maker with big plays."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-buffalo-sabres-game-33-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Rasmus Dahlin on the team’s mindset after 11 straight losses:,"Honestly, I think the best thing is to put it behind us. Everyone has got to put it behind them. You can’t control what’s been done. All we have to do now is move forward. We have to start on a new page and build. We are a good team. This is not who we are. I’m excited for the challenge. Hopefully, we can do something really, really good and start the new page. Anything can happen."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/03/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-minnesota-wild-game-13-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Wild head coach John Hynes on the challenge presented by theLeafs:,"They are getting their game (together), but they are a dangerous team. With Craig (Berube) there, there is a little more forechecking and pucks in (deep) than in the past, but they create off of that. They are hard-working. They have talent. You have to be ready. You see them play that game against Winnipeg, and then you say, “That is the team we have to be prepared for.” They are a dangerous team and a good team. They are one of the top teams in the league for a reason. You have to be on top of your game."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/03/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-minnesota-wild-game-13-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the challenge presented by the 7-1-2 Wild:,"They are not giving up a whole lot up, to be honest with you. Good defense. That top line is dangerous. Kirill is a heck of a player. Zuccarello is a great passer. They have some mobile D; their D skate well. It will be a challenge."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/03/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-minnesota-wild-game-13-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the areas for improvement after last night’s 4-2 loss in St. Louis:,"A better second period. We had a good first period and did everything that we wanted to do in the game. I thought we were in real good control even at the start of the second, but we extended our shifts in the second and got caught out there. They got the momentum with a couple of goals. Our game was good in the first period. It was nothing fancy — putting pucks to good areas and creating shot volume. We could’ve had three goals in the first period, but it didn’t happen, and that is the way the game goes. There is no reason to get off page in the second period. That is something we have to keep banging away it. We have done it a few times this year. We have to keep looking at it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/03/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-minnesota-wild-game-13-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on managing minutes in a back-to-back situation:,"I try to [manage the minutes] in the first game. The minutes were pretty good, but when you get to the end, you are trying to win it. You get your top guys out there more than you probably want to. We will see how the game goes, but we need everybody to contribute and play some minutes tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/03/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-minnesota-wild-game-13-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Matthew Knies on the challenge presented by the Wild:,"They have been rolling. Their top lines have been scoring a lot. Dangerous power play. We are going to try to limit their chances and stay out of the box. We have taken a lot of penalties, and it has taken us out of games and run us down. The better we can do with that, we can keep those guys off the scoresheet and give ourselves a chance to win."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/03/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-minnesota-wild-game-13-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Knies on returning to the state where he played college hockey for an NHL game vs. the Wild:,It is awesome. It is a lot of fun. A lot of good memories here. I am excited to be back and to get my first chance to play at the Xcel Energy Center.

The top guys are heavy on their sticks. It is a hard team to play against in the defensive zone. That has been fun to watch."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/11/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Edmundson on witnessing Auston Matthews’ 70-goal chase:,"I am just happy to be on this side now. Over the years, you see him taking those steps every year. Every year, he is harder to beat in the battles in the corners. He is heavy on his stick. Everyone knows his offensive ability, but he is a full 200-foot player. It is cool to watch."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/11/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Edmundson on missing time through injury so soon after joining the team:,"It was definitely frustrating, but we have so many solid defensemen who can jump in. They’ve been playing solid. It makes it a little easier, but it is never fun watching hockey. If it was playoffs, I would’ve played right through it. It wasn’t that big of an injury. We just wanted to make sure I was 100% before getting back. I am feeling 100% now. I’ve been able to skate for the last couple of weeks. I am feeling good."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/11/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Edmundson on getting to know the defense group in Toronto:,I played with Morgan back in junior. We are all very close. A lot of the guys are chatter boxes who like to talk and have fun. I feel like I have been sitting beside someone new every day in the locker room.

The line did a great job of playing below the goal line and getting opportunities by the net."

They’re deep. They have four lines. They can put guys in and out of the lineup. It is the same on their D. They are deep on the backend. There is no reason why they aren’t one of the top teams—and they are right now."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/11/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Green on Joel Edmundson’s return to the lineup for Toronto:,I have seen him a lot even going back to his junior days. He is a big guy and a competitive player. He is long. He has been a good defenseman in the league for a long time. It is a good addition for them.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/11/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Green on Devils call-up Graeme Clarke playing his second-ever NHL game tonight in Toronto:,"It will be an exciting game. I talked to him quickly out there just to get him laughing a little bit and smiling. Whenever you are an Ontario kid, getting to play in Toronto is going to be special for him. He might be a little bit nervous. I told him to just enjoy it and take it all in. We had him playing with Nico. Our wingers might shuffle around a little bit. We have some young guys in the lineup. We might adjust as we go."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/11/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Green on the Devils playing out the string without any playoff hopes:,"You always worry when you are coaching a team and the time does come when you are not making the playoffs. You worry about a little bit of a mental letdown, but it goes back to what we have talked about since day one with our identity and being a team that can win long term and win in the playoffs. When you love winning, and you are ultra-competitive, it doesn’t really matter if you are playing hockey or playing checkers. You are going to play the right way."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/11/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Sheldon Keefe on whether he is concerned about the team straying from the game plan to try to make sure Auston Matthews hits 70:,"Am I concerned about it? Not necessarily. I think the guys have done a good job of it. It has been good. I look at the goals that the group has scored and Auston has scored, and the process has been good. The guys haven’t cheated the game. They haven’t forced anything. I know whether Auston should’ve been on with the goalie out got lots of play. He was going to be out. He was the next man up. He was not going to be out there 4-on-6 — it is not a situation he plays in, and to me, that would be forcing it. At 6-on-5, he was the next guy up. We just didn’t get the line change we wanted at the time. To me, the guys are just going out and playing. That is the best way. If you want to add to your goal total, just go out and play. Those are good players who have been dominating play. Just go out and go about it the right way. It is already remarkable what Auston has accomplished, right? The number continues to grow. No one in the league has reached this number, which is terrific to watch. Auston is feeling really good right now. He has lots of energy. You can see it in his play. Talking to him, you can see it. You can see the way he interacts with his teammates. He is playing with a free mind. You can see it out there. We will keep going about it. He is a big part of our team process, and he will score goals through that."

At certain points in a season, you can really find a rhythm, and they have obviously found it as of late. It is going to be a big challenge for us. It’s an exciting game. It’s a game we should all be excited to get up for. It is going to be a good atmosphere in here tonight."

Montreal is playing really well right now, too. You can feel the energy in the city walking around. There are a lot ofLeafsfans and a lot of Habs fans. It is a cool environment to be around. I obviously didn’t grow up in it like a lot of Canadians did, but I have definitely grown to love it."

We are trying to be clean with the puck and generate momentum in that sense — stopping plays and getting it going the other way. We read off of each other pretty well and have similar mindsets out there. It has been working pretty well.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/18/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-game-47-preview-projected-lines-tv-info-2/,Max Pacioretty on the importance of McCabe’s return to the lineup:,"You saw last game how valuable he is to this group. Defense is so important in this league right now. If one guy goes down, it kind of mixes up the whole shuffle. For a guy that important to our group on and off the ice, we felt it big time. It is nice to see him back and contributing."

You can wonder why I would want to learn all of that, but you have a whole new appreciation for guys who go out there and maybe don’t get the benefit of the doubt every night when they are not feeling good. You have a whole new appreciation for guys who have had to grind throughout it all. Nothing has been handed to them. When you are able to overcome adversity like that, it makes you a better person and a better player. I have had different types of adversity in my career, but this is a little different. I am just enjoying the grind."

Our second and third efforts were excellent, as well as our battles. We played the game fast with tons of offensive-zone time and shot attempts. We were on our toes. We played as five-man units in all three zones."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/18/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-game-47-preview-projected-lines-tv-info-2/,Berube on the decision to insert Ryan Reaves into the lineup for tonight’s game:,"It is a big game in Montreal. It is a big rivalry. They have some physical players over there. We have to be physical tonight. They are playing extremely well, playing fast and using their skill. They have some really good skill over there. We have to make sure we are ready to go. We have to play a heavy game."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/18/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-game-47-preview-projected-lines-tv-info-2/,Canadiens head coach Martin St. Louis on the buy-in from his group:,"As coaches, you have to sell. Our job is to convince them why we want to do things a certain way. If they are not convinced, they are not going to buy in. We are selling. We are trying to sell and show examples. We have conversations and debates. I think it is a very open forum. There is a direction where we want to be. I have always said that I don’t think I am a dictator. I will lean on my players and ask for their opinion, but it is not about being a “right” fighter. It is just about getting it right for the group. Our job is to hold them accountable to our truth."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/31/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-islanders-game-38-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the challenge presented by the Islanders:,"They are a pretty deep team all around. They have six defensemen who are over 6’1 or 6’2. Good goalie. Pretty balanced lineup up front. They came in here last time and beat us, so we have to be ready to go. It is going to be a tough game. They are not going to give you anything for free. They’ve always been a stingy defensive team. I expect the same."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/31/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-islanders-game-38-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the keys to ending the five-game losing streak versus the Islanders:,"Well, we know what they are. They have been a certain way for quite some time as a team with their identity and how they play. They are a patient team. They don’t give you a ton. You have to earn your chances. It is important for us not to get impatient. We have to stay with it. It could be a really tight game, so we just have to stay with it. At times, going through the past [matchups] — I wasn’t here, but I looked into it a little bit — it was just about getting impatient at times. It’s committing to staying patient and taking what they give you. That is it. We have to do a good job of it. The last time we played them here, we just opened it up too much. They capitalized on the chances. More than anything, it’s the biggest key."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/31/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-islanders-game-38-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the increase in rush offense against as of late:,"To me, there are a couple of areas: puck management is one, and quicker reloads by our forwards. It is not so much just our F3; it is our F1 and F2 getting beat up the ice by their D, and now there are gaps, and now teams are coming in, delaying, and making plays off the rush. We have to have numbers back quicker than we are right now. It is more urgency and puck play — not turning pucks over in high ice, because that makes it difficult, right? If you turn a puck over in the high ice in the offensive zone, teams are coming. We have to be better at that."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/31/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-islanders-game-38-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on shifting David Kampf into 2C with Matthew Knies and William Nylander:,I am just trying to find a little more balance with that line. I like Domi’s line right now. They are producing for us. I didn’t want to break them up. That is all. I am just trying to find something by moving [Kampf] up into that hole.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/31/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-islanders-game-38-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Bo Horvat on his explanation for the Islanders’ inconsistency this season:,"I wish I could (explain it). It is all about consistency in the league. That is why the best teams are at the top: they are rolling together wins. Right now, this win-one, lose-one thing is not going to do us any favours going forward. For the rest of the year, if we continue to do this, we are not going to move up the standings at all. It is on us to get the ball rolling there."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/31/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-islanders-game-38-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Islanders head coach Patrick Roy on his team’s inconsistent five-on-five offense:,"If we want to score goals at five-on-five… If you want to score on your shot, you better be a good shooter. If not, you are going to have to drive the net and find ways to get those rebounds. That’s how this league works now. You have to grind for those goals."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/30/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-game-23-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the team’s success in their 5-2 win vs. Tampa in October:,"I thought we did a real good job checking in that game, creating some turnovers, and capitalizing on some odd-man rushes. William Nylander walked in and scored on a 2-on-1. He had another 2-on-1 where he passed it. I thought we did a good job in the neutral zone of creating some offense from our checking and transition game. It was a good game. Both teams competed really hard. Our PK had to be good. All around, it was a pretty solid game by us. We have to do the same tonight. We have to be disciplined; they have a really good power play, as we all know. It will be key to be disciplined, but we need to be physical."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/30/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-game-23-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on Matthew Knies’ return to the top power-play unit:,"Big guy, and he does a good job there. If you look at Hyman on Edmonton — he is looking at some of the stuff Hyman does. He is that type of guy. You love the size and the strength there, too. Big body, and he has a good stick for tipping pucks in and stuff like that. He is only going to get better over time and become a really good net-front guy on the power play."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/30/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-game-23-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Lightning head coach Jon Cooper on the return of Auston Matthews:,"He has missed a bit, right? Hopefully, he is rusty. That is all I can ask. You talk about gifted players and the ability to take over a game. He is one of those kids. I kind of wish he was coming back for the next game, but part of me is always like, “I like seeing these guys play.” If we have a chance to beat the Leafs, we may as well beat the Leafs when they have their best lineup in. We’re not trying to take a freebie. I am glad he is back. He is good for this league."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/30/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-game-23-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Cooper on the difference in Mitch Marner’s game from when he coached him at the 2017 World Championships after Marner’s rookie NHL season:,"Probably confidence and swag. He has always had it, but you see it in how he plays. I am a massive Mitch Marner fan, having been able to coach him in 2017. He has always had it in him, but I think he has let it out in a little bit more — in a good way. He is not showing off. He does everything with a purpose. He really thinks the game. It’s amazing how he thinks it. It is elite."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/30/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-game-23-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Cooper on Andrei Vasilevskiy’s off night versus the Leafs back on Oct. 21 (a 5-2 Leafs win):,Vasi is our starter. He plays 60+ games a year. I don’t care if you are Vasilevskiy or if you go through the top 10 goalies in the league; guys have off nights in this league. The difference between the good ones and the great ones is that the great ones don’t have many off nights. That has been a staple of Vasilevskiy’s career.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/06/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,"Martin St. Louis on the challenge of matching up against aLeafsteam with Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner, and William Nylander on separate lines:","It is similar when you play Edmonton. It is a little bit easier — well, maybe not easier — if they have McDavid and Draisaitl together. You have the responsibility for one line, so to speak, but when they start spreading it, you have to deal with that collectively more. We have seen other teams do that. It is a nice thing to have for them to be able to spread it. It makes it harder to match and focus on one line. It becomes more of a collective challenge."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/06/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,St. Louis on whether he thought a possible 70-goal scorer would be possible in the modern NHL:,Yeah. The game is more offensive. The power plays are better. The players are more talented. I am not surprised.

We are a couple of weeks away [from the playoffs]. We will use the last seven games to get ready to go, clean up some things, and work on some details. When it comes to playoff hockey, you need everyone — not just three lines but four lines, six defensemen, two goalies, and some extras who are going to jump in. We are just gearing towards that and looking forward to the challenge."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/06/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,John Tavares on reuniting with Mitch Marner on his RW:,It will be great. He plays in all situations. Play goes through him a ton. He has the puck a ton. He makes a ton of plays. Tremendous awareness and hockey sense. I’ve enjoyed playing with him since I’ve been here. It will be great playing with him again today.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/06/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Tavares on whether Matthews should receive Hart and Selke nominations:,"He should be right in the mix and nominated for both with the type of season he is having and what he could potentially do from a goal-scoring standpoint. To be able to do that and be as well-rouned as he is even more impressive. He is not just a trigger guy or is always put in offensive situations. He plays in all areas of the game. He carries play. He wins so many puck battles. His takeaways are exceptional. I don’t think he gets enough credit for how smart he is and the positions he puts himself in, especially with how hard teams defend him and how he consistently finds open space with the timing of all of those sorts of things. He is as well-rounded of a player as you are going to find in our game today. It would be great to see him get the recognition on both of those fronts."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/06/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Sheldon Keefe on his vision for the team’s balanced attack:,"We can talk about first line, second line, and third line, but the way I would like it to be is that each game could be different. William’s line could be the first line tonight. When you have the talent spread out like this, it is more about who is going on that particular night. On great nights, all of them would be going, but that is the idea: you have it spread out, and you get opportunities for different lines to go. Our fourth line with Kampf, Reavo, and Dewar might have been our best line the other night. That is really what you are looking for—to get all of your groups thriving. Whether it is William on that line, Mitch with John, or Auston with Max and Bert, I expect those guys to drive it and be leaders in each of those groups."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/06/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-montreal-canadiens-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,St. Louis on the development of Alex Newhook in his first season as a Hab:,"Like every young player, you try to explain to them to play the game, not just his game. He has a lot of speed. Most of his life growing up with that speed, he probably had the puck a lot. You try to make him understand that at this level, the game is played without the puck. I feel he has taken huge strides on both sides of the puck to really be engaged — not just start getting engaged when the puck touches his stick. He finds some great pockets. He has good speed. I think he is learning to decelerate, too, to keep those pockets… It is learning to use [the speed] to get into position and not to let it take you out of position. We are on blades. We glide. There is a lot of momentum. To control the speed is really important on both sides of the puck so that he keeps us in balance on the ice. I have been really happy with his progression on both sides of the puck."

I think we’ve gotten away from it lately, in my opinion, on the checking side of things. We have to get back to that where we are tight all over and are not giving up much. I find we are giving a little bit too much up right now and are a little loose at times. The other thing is puck management."

We were loose in front of him last game, especially early in the game, giving two goals up in five minutes. It is tough for the goalie, right? They weren’t easy saves. They were tough plays. He has played well for us. I expect the same going forward."

Toronto got after us pretty good. We turned a lot of pucks over, both in our end of the rink and also getting through the neutral zone. They do a really good job with their 1-2-2. They clog up space. We are going to have to be a lot better from the start. I liked how we got out against Minnesota (last game). It is the same thing here. In these afternoon games, you have to make sure you are ready. [TheLeafs] are good in this building. We have to be sharp."

There is maybe a little bit of a misconception that we are trying to play this shutdown, defensive game, which we are definitely not. We want to be an aggressive team that plays very fast and plays winning hockey. With today’s analytics, you can see where your team is. I really like what we’ve done with expected goals against. With expected goals for, we are 20th for the year, and 15th since December 1st. If you are in the top half of the league offensively and you are right near the top defensively, it is a pretty good recipe for winning. We have preached playing the game the right way and not cheating the game. We want to take away time and space and create time and space. We have done a good job of forechecking and creating chances. We are in the top 10 there. But we are not finishing, quite frankly. I think we are 32nd in finishing, and some of our guys have been snakebitten. Sometimes that happens. I like the way we are playing overall this season. There have been games I didn’t like, and that is going to happen. I know the score was close in Boston, but I didn’t like our game. I didn’t think we played well enough to win that game. We are going to have to be much better tonight to win."

They’re always exciting games. For it to be intense and to have a true rivalry, both teams have to be playing for something. That creates a lot more passion in the game. You definitely know that there will be a buzz. Whenever theLeafsand Senators play, there is going to be a buzz in both towns. There will be one tonight, and rightfully so."

They are maturing as it goes along. It starts on the backend with Sanderson and Chabot, and then up front, there is Stutzle and Tkachuk. They have a number of different guys and play a good brand of hockey, I think. It is always a tough battle against them. In the last time they were in this building, they took advantage of us. We have to be emotionally invested in the game, and get to our game as quickly as possible in their building."

Detroit did a good job of that last night, too. It’s about making sure you are above and not really taking a breath. They can skate and like to join. You have to be aware of them joining late in the rush and the turn-ups. We have to keep our heads on a swivel, and as defensemen, we can kind of bark out orders, too, if we see them on the rush."

Even in the Anaheim game, we gave up a few rush chances in the first period, and last night, we got scored on twice on it. We have to clean it up. It starts in the offensive zone for me with reloads, more urgency by our forwards, and reading the rush better coming out of our zone. We can’t give up two goals off the rush. We have to be better there."

He really skated well, shot the puck, and attacked. It was good to see. Offensively, we had a lot of good lucks. We just have to bear down and bury them. We missed the net on shots at times. We did a good job of creating looks. We were at the net, which was good to see. We got a goal being at the net. We just have to stick with it."

https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-bruins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Sheldon Keefe on the challenge against a “struggling” Bruins team with seven losses in their last 10:,They are an elite team. Boston “struggling” is teams barely being able to beat them in overtime or shootouts. They are in every single game. They make it very hard to play against them. It is never an easy night.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-bruins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Keefe on the look of his blue line on Saturday before Ilya Lyubushkin’s injury:,"It looked like it was flowing well. In talking to Mike Van Ryn, he felt good about all three pairs being able to play against anybody and being able to just let the guys flow out the door. The lefty-righty pieces for Brodie and Rielly’s partners seemed to help them with both having right-handed partners. It was very encouraging what we saw. Boosh — despite the fact that he was working on four or five hours of sleep, a three-hour time change, and he was coming off a big trade with no practice with us — stepped in and looked very comfortable."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-bruins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Ilya Lyubushkin on the Matt Rempe hit on Saturday and leaving the game:,"I saw it coming, but I didn’t have time to protect myself. It’s okay. It happens sometimes. It’s protocol. Nothing we can do."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-bruins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Lyubushkin on Ryan Reaves fighting Rempe in response:,It is so nice by him. He is a good guy and a good teammate. I feel good that we have him on this team.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-bruins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Ryan Reaves on the magnitude of tonight’s game:,It is a team we’re chasing. We’re a couple of points back. They took points off of us a couple of times this year already. It is a huge game. It is going to set the tone for the game in their building in a couple of days. This is probably the biggest game of the week.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-bruins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Bruins head coach Jim Montgomery on his team’s 5-1 loss to the Islanders on Saturday:,"We just weren’t good enough and weren’t firm enough. We didn’t start the game on time. For whatever reason, we weren’t very good. We have to move on and get ready for a Toronto team that is playing really well."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-bruins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Montgomery on whether he read the riot act to his team after the blowout loss:,"It is a little late in the year to read the riot act. We didn’t get to our game. It’s just about being honest with them, reviewing the tape, and showing anything of value to the team."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-bruins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Montgomery on where his team’s focus lies as they look to turn it around:,Getting back to our checking habits. It’s probably slipped since the All-Star break. It is a combination of us not delivering the message well enough and the players not executing.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-bruins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Montgomery on the difference in the Leafs’ play compared to earlier in the season:,"They look a lot better on offense, defense, and special teams. Everything is clicking."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-52-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Connor McDavid on the Leafs vs. Oilers HNIC matchup:,"The guys are excited. We get the 5 p.m. start time, which is always nice. They come into our building, and we have to change our schedule around. It is what it is. It is exciting. It is always fun to play against the Leafs and their big names. They have some special players over there. It is always fun. I don’t think they love their game right now, either. They are looking to score some goals, and we are looking to stop giving up chances. It will be a good test for both sides."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-52-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the 5 p.m. start time:,Fine with me. I don’t focus on it too much. It is what it is. That’s what TV does.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-52-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on his forward line combinations with the team now healthier:,"Those lines were together before, and we had three lines creating offense at that point. Bobby McMann, with Max Domi and Nick Robertson, were scoring for us — secondary scoring. Before Patches got hurt for the second time, the line with Willy and Johnny was good for us, too. You always have pairs that are consistent. I’ve always moved the third guy around a little bit depending on how things looked and how things are going; you can mix it up a little bit. But I do like working in pairs. Mitch and Matthews have been a pair all year. Johnny and Willy have a pair pretty much all year. Max (Domi) and Bobby have been a pair for quite a bit of a stretch this year, too."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-52-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the takeaways from the team’s 4-3 OT win over Edmonton in November:,"You look back at the game and the things you did well on your side of things, but you also look at how the Oilers are playing now. It is a little bit of a different situation, with how the Oilers are playing now. We have to be prepared for that. Their power play is clicking better. Also, they look like they are playing a quicker game. They are looking to play fast all the time and get going, putting teams on their heels as much as they can. That is what I see when I watch them. They have some great players you have to be aware of and be on top of as much as possible by taking away time and space away, but they are playing fast as a team. We have to be on our toes and play fast ourselves. We can’t sit back and watch them. We have to get going. We have to be aggressive."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-52-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Jake McCabe on the challenge of matching up with McDavid-Draisaitl on one line:,"They like to move them around, and they play together a lot, even if they are not on a line together. They are going to be out there a lot with each other in offensive-zone situations and at certain times in the period. It is something we are used to seeing. Just have to be aware of it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-52-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,McCabe on whether there is any temptation to look ahead to the Four Nations break:,We’ve lost three straight. Our focus is on winning hockey games.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-52-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Max Pacioretty on how the team can score more goals:,"Maybe being a little bit grittier around the net. It is no surprise or secret that we have been trying to play a little bit differently than they were last year — a little bit more of a north-south style. Sometimes, it takes a little bit of grit to get to the inside with extra effort and battles in front of the net to get a second or third chance or beat your defenseman to the net off the wall. It sounds simple, and we are trying to play a bit more of a simple game, but it comes with a bit of an attitude that you are going to win your check. Ultimately, that can help you score goals. It has come in waves. There have been times when we have felt very good about our game, and there have been times when it’s not so much. That is the same for any team in any season. You want to peak at the right time. It hasn’t been perfect, and we have had a bit of adversity with injuries, but the good thing is that we know what we need to do to be successful. It is not like we are questioning how we have to play. We know what it takes for our group to be successful and to play that north-south style. It is up to us to execute."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-52-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Pacioretty on the Jake McCabe-Chris Tanev pairing:,"When you go back for a puck with those two, it is predictable, knowing where it is going to go and how it is going to come out of the zone. More often than not, it is going to come out of the zone with control. That is what the top teams and top players do — the predictability. They are two guys who go about their business the right way, and it shows."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-52-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Pacioretty on playing on a line with William Nylander:,"I love how he sees the game so much differently than anyone I’ve played with. That is what makes him so good, and it is also what makes him unique. I talked about predictability and how our team wants to play, but the top players in the league don’t play like the other guys. They have to have a little bit of uniqueness in them. I love trying to pick his brain about hockey and why he is so good. I don’t think he even knows why he is so good. He has these little things that he works on that no one else works on — little skating drills that he does before practice that I’ve never seen before. It is cool to be around such good players who play really differently from each other. It shows that there is not one way to play. But it is no secret they all work so hard at their craft, and that is why they are some of the best."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-52-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Oilers head coach Kris Knoblauch on moving Corey Perry onto McDavid’s right wing:,"With Corey, he is having a pretty successful year. He is playing 10-12 minutes and is among our team leaders in five-on-five points behind McDavid and Draisaitl. He is probably number three in points per 60. Leon and Connor will play 22-24 minutes, and Corey will not be playing 22-24 minutes, so it will be more of a job by committee. There will be guys who will be up in that spot, but there will be certain situations where we lean on Corey more and other guys in other situations."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-52-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Knoblauch on the challenge of matching up against Matthews:,"For one, he is a tremendous skater. He is strong. He can’t get knocked off the puck easily. It is similar to the way Leon plays, but maybe with more speed and not as much strength as Leon. His shooting ability, especially with how quick and hard the wrist shot is, I am not sure anyone else can shoot the puck like he does. If you give him an opportunity and a little space, he becomes dangerous. It requires an awareness when he is on the ice to not give him that space."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-52-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Knoblauch on the meaning of a Leafs vs. Oilers matchup:,"It’s exciting, especially when we have so many players from Ontario. They get excited to play against certain teams. Those guys from Ontario — I am sure a lot of them cheered for the Leafs when they were kids, and they like playing against the Leafs. Playing good teams usually brings out the best in yourself because you know it is going to be a challenge. You know you can’t win playing below average, whereas on some nights, you can kind of get away with it. We are playing a good team and one we are excited to play against."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-52-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Knoblauch on John Klingberg’s season debut on Thursday:,"He played better than we expected. He hasn’t played for 14 or 15 months and was coming in mid-season. If you look at his first shift, the first time he touched the puck, he made a hell of a play to break the puck out to Leon, which led to a great rush look. There was the pass he made in the second period to McDavid. A lot of good things, and that is what we are looking for: a guy who can move the puck. The best defense is a good offense because you are moving the puck up and spending time in the offensive zone. I think he can help us tremendously in that area."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-florida-panthers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Sheldon Keefe on whether he thinks the emotions of what happened last spring will carry over tonight:,"It is less about what happened in the spring. We have a lot of different people here. It is more that it is just a really good team. It is a divisional team, a team that plays you hard, and a team that doesn’t give you an inch. The game is very competitive in nature because of the style of play. It couldn’t be more polar opposite than the types of games or styles of games that we played last week. It is going to be a different feel. We have to be ready for it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-florida-panthers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Ryan Reaves on tonight’s matchup:,"I’m expecting a fun one. It’s a pretty direct team that likes to play physical and obviously a team that beat this team last year in the playoffs. It’s going be physical, it’s going be direct, it’s going be high intensity, it’s going to feel like a playoff game, and it’s a potential playoff matchup. I think it’s going be everything you would expect."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-florida-panthers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Jake McCabe on Florida’s defensive prowess:,They’re really structured defensively. They play really hard. They’re competitive and they make it hard on you in all three zones of the ice. They play a really direct game and put lots of stress on your net. You have to be strong in front of your net and be good with the puck and don’t give them any freebies. We’ve got to try to get in on the forecheck and spend some time in their end.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-florida-panthers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Ryan Reaves on whether 70 goals is still possible for Auston Matthews:,80 is possible for that guy.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-florida-panthers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Paul Maurice on how he plans to defend Auston Matthews:,"Well, man, what game is it? 74? He’s got 60 goals, so nobody’s figured that out. I’m not the smartest guy in the league. I’m just going to put a bunch of guys out and hope they can defend the hell out of it, if we can. You are not stopping him. You just hope he scores the next night, not the night you’re in town. Brilliant, brilliant player. In that elite category of players around the league that you don’t stop. He is going to get his. You hope your goalie has a good night. You hope the posts are a little thinner at their end than ours, and you play hard."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-florida-panthers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Maurice on the meeting with Toronto after a long break from each other:,"I think both teams are just trying to dial it in now and get as close to their game as they possibly can. It is weird not seeing a team in your own division for four months, so it is maybe a reintroduction of games. Both teams have added players and changed the way they look a little bit. Both teams are still driven by the best players on the team. We’ll just kind of get out there and get to know each other again tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-florida-panthers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Maurice on the fact that this is a potential playoff matchup in round one:,"We have a certain style of hockey that we play, and they have [theirs]. We are both going to play it tonight. If we see each other in two weeks, no one is going to remember this game. We are going to play hard, and they are going to play hard. It is game 74-ish. Both teams have had strong enough years that they have to play eight more games until the playoffs. Everyone wants to feel good, but everyone wants to get to the playoffs pretty hard. The difference between us and Boston and maybe even Tampa in the standings is probably based on the schedule and luck on injuries. We are all in the same pool of teams. What is important for us is that we feel like in our last five games, we are coming back to our game. You can’t play it all year. We were really consistent with it, and then we had a couple of weeks where we wobbled a little bit. We were inconsistent. It is not in wins and losses. It is in style of play. The rush game opened up. That is not how we look. In the last five, even with injuries, I think we are coming back to it. That is the key for us: to look the way we are supposed to look."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/01/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-florida-panthers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Maurice on whether this game sets the tone for a potential playoff matchup:,"I truly don’t think that it matters. I am not a huge believer in momentum or in regular-season success. I have been in playoff series against teams we didn’t beat all year, and we beat them in the playoffs. The opposite is true, too. I am not trying to lower the importance of this game. I also have an understanding that things are occasionally made bigger than they are [in Toronto]. I don’t think it matters. It didn’t matter between game three and four in the series last year… Teams have come back from three down in a playoff series. How does that happen? Momentum doesn’t matter. I am going to bet that both teams are excited about the game tonight. I thought the best game we have played in the last couple of weeks was the Boston game. It was a hell of a game. Shots were 21-21, and there wasn’t a boring 30 seconds in the night, at least from the bench. I think we are going to see that kind of energy from both teams. It is a good game to watch."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vegas-golden-knights-game-20-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Bruce Cassidy on the challenge against aLeafsteam with several injuries up front:,"Marner is always a threat. In my days in Boston, Nylander was a Bruin killer. We know that John Tavares is having a great year. They still have a lot of offensive threats. We don’t see them a lot being out west, but they are tighter in front of the net taking care of business. They are probably a different animal than I am used to seeing, but I have seen a lot of Chief’s teams before. They are going to play hard and play together. It should be a good game that way. We tend to play well in those types of games. Hopefully, that gets us excited."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vegas-golden-knights-game-20-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Cassidy on Chris Tanev’s game:,"He did a good job against us last year in the playoffs with Dallas. He eats a lot of pucks and values the defensive side of it. He really takes pride in shutting down the other team’s best players. He did a good job of it, and their whole D did last year. He is a hard-nosed guy."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vegas-golden-knights-game-20-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on Max Domi missing tonight’s game:,"It was just time. He needs some time off to rest and get healthy. That is the bottom line. He practiced yesterday, but he wasn’t doing well. He wants to play, but we have to do what is best for him, too. He’ll get some time off. We don’t play again until Sunday, so he’ll get some rest and heal up."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vegas-golden-knights-game-20-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the message to Nikita Grebenkin ahead of his NHL debut:,"I haven’t had a chance to watch him a ton with theMarlies, but he is a big guy. He is strong. He is strong on pucks and physical. That’s his game. Use it to your advantage. Be smart with pucks. Be simple and smart. Use your size in the offensive zone and your strength on the puck. Get your shots off, and get to the net. Be responsible defensively. The biggest thing I tell all these guys is that you have to be responsible defensively."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/20/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vegas-golden-knights-game-20-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the jolt a couple of rookies can provide in the lineup:,I don’t mind it at all. I think both kids have a great future. Minten is a really intelligent player and two-way centerman. He is a very responsible player. I am looking forward to seeing both of them tonight.

We have been kind of rotating here, and I think it has worked well. We are going to continue to do that."

I don’t want him sitting too long. Hak came in and did a good job, but it is just a coach’s decision tonight."

I have a bit of experience under my belt, so I know what to expect. I am still new to the league, though. Still new to me."

It takes a collective five-man effort out there to slow him down. Stay out of the box. Shutting down the opposing team’s best players is a great test for us defensemen, especially, and something I relish and look forward to. It is no different tonight. It just happens to be #97. It is a little bit more of a challenge than some other players, but it is going to take a group of five out there every shift to slow him down."

We do a pretty good job of making sure we are on the same page about what we are looking for, where we are going to be in certain situations and for certain plays, and what I am seeing and he is seeing.

I hope he feels the same about my game. We are kind of feeding off of each other in that sense. We relish these chances to go against other team’s top lines. It is our job to keep the puck out of the net. We will continue to do that tonight.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-19-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Tanev on the matchup challenge against McDavid:,"He is an incredible player. You just saw what he did the other day. It takes a full team to play good defense for 60 minutes against him. You try to get above him and manage the puck. You don’t want to give them odd-man rushes, especially with three-quarters ice at their blue line. They are a really good transition team. That is where they can catch you."

Such a great feeling. It has been a long time coming. A lot of hard work and hours were put into get there. It was special. In general, I always felt it was coming. You just have to keep working and trust the process. Sure, there have been some moments when you are grinding away back home in Finland and think, “Does it ever come?” But there has always been that overlying trust. It is like with any injury where you’re coming back. There are days where you’re like, “I just wish I was there already.” It is part of the process. It makes you stronger and tougher. With any injury, once you come out of it, you are better coming back."

That is the way I would put it. You have to be aware of where he is at and where everything is at on the ice. You have to give it your best. A lot of times, with him or any other great player, you need all five guys out there on the same page helping out. It is challenging, but it is fun at the same time. It is what you want to do: compete against the best in the world."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-19-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the challenge presented by the Oilers:,"They play a very fast game. They are very good off the rush, obviously, with McDavid and Draisaitl. Their D are very active up the ice. We have to do a good job, starting in the offensive zone, of not getting beat up the ice and trying to stay tight to these guys to take away their speed. Their power play is starting to get going. They are dangerous on it. We all know it. Discipline is going to be important, and our penalty kill."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-19-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Oilers head coach Kris Knoblauch on the differences in the Leafs this season vs. last:,"You notice it a lot more when you are behind the bench and see it in person, but you can see the team playing very good defensive hockey. They added to the backend, so that has a lot to do with it. We only watch a handful of games. They are in game #17 or #18 for them. It is an unfair assessment to say, “They’ve changed this much from last year.”"
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-19-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Zach Hyman on the Oilers’ recent 7-3 stretch after their slow start to the season:,"Our special teams are starting to come along a little bit. It was a huge strength of ours last year and one of the reasons we were able to go as far as we did. Both were off to a slower start, per se, and in the last couple of games, they have started to come around. Our five-on-five play has been really good. We are holding the puck more in the offensive zone and creating chances off the cycle. We are starting to see progress in our game."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-game-19-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Hyman on lining up against Chris Tanev:,"He is an amazing player. We train with him in the summer. Gary (Roberts) and a bunch of us do. I have gotten to know him well. Great person. Great guy for their locker room. On the ice, he is just a warrior. I am sure you guys have gotten a taste of it in the first 20 games or so. No matter what night it is, he is blocking shots. He isn’t necessarily always the most physical presence, but he is always in the right position, always has a great stick, breaks the puck out great, and is just a real good player."

Saturday night hockey in front of lots of friends and family. Of course it means more.

I think we have done a good job all year of not letting a not-so-great game slip into two. We are looking forward to the opportunity to do that. We are going to need everyone.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Jake McCabe on the process of bouncing back from the loss to the Devils:,It is pretty clear on video whenever you have breakdowns whether it is on the forecheck or in the d-zone coverage. Those are things that are easy to clean up. I expect that we will clean it up tonight.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,McCabe on the injuries and illnesses continuing to persist throughout the team:,"Guys have done a good job of stepping in throughout the lineup. We have been rotating a lot on the backend with a lot of guys in and out as well as up front with injuries and illness. Some of our best games this year, frankly, have been when we are shorthanded. It is a good sign."

Washington came hard as well, and we played through that. I thought our best players were dominant. All of those things contributed to a good win."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Keefe on the Capitals turning it around under head coach Spencer Carbery:,"Over the last couple of months, they have been excellent, but throughout the season, there have been a few key points where it looked like maybe it was going to go the wrong way. They have come back in a big way and sustained it. The power play, over the last 25 games, has been the best in the NHL. They have a lot of good things going for them. I am thrilled for him. He’s done a terrific job. The players have responded after some personnel changes throughout the season. Younger players have gotten more of an opportunity. They are quicker, and there is a little more pop to what they are doing."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-washington-capitals-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Keefe on the keys to quieting the Capitals’ red-hot power play led by Alex Ovechkin:,"Try to minimize the time we spend in our own zone. That is a big one. Get as many clears as we can and be clean coming out. Recognize our triggers and pressures. Normally, the one-timer becomes most available when you have breakdowns in other places that force you to overreact. It then becomes available on the backside. That is really it. We will try to limit those mistakes and breakdowns and stay out of the box as best we can. Whether it is a one-timer or not, their whole group is going right now. They are the best in the NHL in the past 25 games, and he is a huge part of their success or surge. We are going to have to manage that by staying out of the box and then accepting the challenge and getting it done."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-game-60-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Craig Berube on the challenge presented by the Penguins:,"They have a good power play. They have some great players over there who have been around for a long time. They generate a lot of offense. They come at you with a lot of pressure and shoot a lot of pucks. Especially with Karlsson and Letang up there, they fire a lot of pucks. They’re a good team around the net. They are an aggressive hockey team. They come at you and don’t give you a lot of time and space anywhere."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-game-60-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Berube on the keys to victory against a tired Penguins team:,"We don’t get a lot of afternoon games. We have to start on time. Early on in the game, it’s about simplifying the game and not putting yourself in positions to turn pucks over. It’s a simple game. Get it in deep. Let’s put pressure on them. They played yesterday. Let’s put pressure on them. That has to be our mindset: a hounding mindset. Keep the shifts short, roll the next line out there, and get after them that way. For me, it is about shot attempts. Let’s get shots. Let’s shoot pucks. It’s not a bad play to shoot a puck today."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-game-60-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan on his experience coaching Auston Matthews at 4 Nations:,"I didn’t know Auston very well going into that experience. To get to know him personally and to watch his game closer, I was so impressed with his leadership and how he leads by example. He is not an overly vocal guy or a “rah rah” guy. That is not his personality, but the way he competes and his 200-foot game… I was so impressed with his game away from the puck and his commitment to playing defense. He knows what winning hockey is all about. That is the takeaway I came away with from watching him up close. It is his drive and passion. His work ethic in practice was terrific. He just leads by example. That is the kind of person that he is. I could tell early on that he has an appetite to win, and he knows what it takes."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-game-60-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Sullivan on the keys for his team in a tired/back-to-back situation:,"I think our team has handled back-to-backs well this year. A lot of it is about playing a simple and smart game, making sure we don’t beat ourselves, managing the puck the right way, and watching our shift lengths. We are going to have to use the bench. For me, that is the most important part of it: We can’t beat ourselves. We have to manage the game. We have to take what is given out there."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-game-60-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Mitch Marner on his experience with Sidney Crosby as a teammate at 4 Nations:,"Just the leader he is, how he goes about his business, how locked in he is, and how dialed-in he is about everything… It was really cool to be his teammate for a few weeks. Everyone talks about his generosity and how much time he takes out of his day. It doesn’t matter who you are or where you are from. He takes time out of his day, hangs around, and talks about his experiences. We had a couple of team dinners that he was very generous with."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-game-60-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Berube on Calle Jarnkrok nearing a return (expected Monday vs. SJ):,"He brings a lot. He is a very structured player who can play all three positions. He touches a little bit of everything, in my opinion — penalty kill, and he has been used on the power play before. He is kind of a Swiss army knife. You can use him almost anywhere. He complements good hockey players. With skilled players, he does all of the little things for them at the net front, getting pucks out of the corners, and doing the little things for them."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-game-60-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Marner on Jarnkrok’s game:,The speed he brings off the puck opens up ice. He doesn’t sit around the side of the net. He gets to the front. He gets himself in goalies’ eyes a lot and opens up space for other guys. That’s what I’ve found when playing with him.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-game-60-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Marner on the mood around the team amid a four-game winning streak out of the break:,"It’s good. We are keeping it light, but at the same time, we know we haven’t played our best hockey still. We know we have better and have to be better. In saying that, we are keeping it light as well. I think our starts have been a little weak. Our second and thirds have been a lot better than our firsts. We are trying to get ready on time and get going, not wait until the second and third."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-game-60-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Berube on how the 4 Nations players’ energy levels are recovering:,"I have not seen their energy levels as low for the last couple of games, to be honest with you. They are playing good minutes. I don’t see it as an issue. I haven’t seen it for the last two games. They’re in good spots."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/21/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-islanders-game-34-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on Auston Matthews’ situation:,He is just not going to go tonight. He took a cross-check late in the third period on the power play. It just aggravated it.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/21/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-islanders-game-34-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the team’s play without Auston Matthews this season:,"They’ve played well. If you look back at the games when he was out, we checked extremely well because we need to. Was our scoring down a little bit? Yes, but we were still winning close hockey games because everyone was focusing on the checking part and doing their job. Guys stepped up with him out. They stepped up big for us. I expect the same."

They have been sitting for a few days. I am sure they are eager and ready to play.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/21/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-islanders-game-34-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Tanev on the play of the new defense pairings vs. Buffalo:,"Good, for the most part. We moved the puck. We all skated and contributed in our own ways. We have seven really good defensemen. Throughout the year, you are going to play with different people at different times. Being able to play with different guys is really good, and it gives the team flexibility to do what they want on any given night."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/21/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-islanders-game-34-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Nick Robertson on managing a tired situation in the back-to-back:,"Just keep the shifts short to start. The energy is probably not the same as it was before last game, so keep it short, get a feel for the game, and then give it everything we’ve got. We’ve got a day off tomorrow, so there is nothing to keep the energy stored for."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/21/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-islanders-game-34-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Islanders head coach Patrick Roy on the keys to taking advantage of a tiredLeafsteam:,"It is not that much of an advantage. How long is that flight? 20 minutes coming back? It is a short trip for them. Everybody needs to play hard. Sometimes, the first period is an advantage for you because you’ve played the night before against a team that did not, so you get off to a good start. Everybody wants a good start. It is important for them and for us."

With his skill set and his speed out there, I am going to try to really uilize that and get him in good spots with the puck in his hands with open ice. With Johnny, you know what you are getting: consistency, a guy who has a chance to score any time he has the puck in the slot, and he is great at tipping pucks around the net. It will be fun. I am excited."

https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/07/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-seattle-kraken-game-54-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the challenge presented by the Kraken:,"They have a good rush game. With Montour and Dunn back there, they are really involved up in the play. They are a fast team that transitions quickly. Again, we have to have the puck tonight. We have to hang onto it and force them to play in their own zone as much as we can. That will be the key, as well as reloading, getting above people, checking from behind, and not giving up those opportunities. They have some good players with a lot of speed — a lot of speed."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/07/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-seattle-kraken-game-54-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the decision to form a Nylander-Tavares-Marner line:,"I kept the line together with Matthews, Domi, and Knies. I thought they had a really good game (in Calgary). I liked Max on the line. It felt like he had more juice in the game. I want to keep him going. I talked to the guys about William Nylander going on the left wing and Mitch on the right with JT. Mitch has played some really good hockey with JT this year, so we’ll see how it goes."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/07/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-seattle-kraken-game-54-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on whether rust is to be expected from Anthony Stolarz in his first game since December 12:,"That is a good question. Who knows? We’ll see how the game goes. We have to do a good job in front of him and make sure that we are tight tonight, limiting their rush game. (The Kraken) have a really good rush game, and we don’t need to be giving them chances off the rush. Our jobs, as defenders and forwards, is being really good defensively, tight, and not giving that stuff up. We have to check hard tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/10/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-game-2-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the keys to generating more offense than in the season opener:,"We had traffic. I think we didn’t capitalize on rebounds enough. I think we can go downhill a little bit more offensively. At times, we got pucks to the net, obviously, but we didn’t get the rebounds enough for me."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/10/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-game-2-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the challenge of playing an opponent in its home opener:,"There is a lot of waiting around with all of the introduction, but I don’t feel that played into it last night. Our start was good. We took the penalty early, which kind of killed our momentum a little bit, but our guys were ready to go last night. We have to do the same tonight. It is back-to-back on the road for a home opener, but we have to mentally be ready to go, have a strong start, and manage things early. Be straight line, play north early, and be patient. Don’t allow them to get above us."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/10/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-game-2-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the expectations for Bobby McMann as he re-enters the lineup:,"Use his size and his speed to be a power forward kind of player. That’s what he should be. He can really skate and is strong on pucks. Take things to the net, get to the net offensively, and be responsible defensively."

https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/10/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-game-2-projected-lines-tv-info/,Anthony Stolarz on Hildeby:,"He was tremendous in preseason. I was with him in a lot of the sessions. He has a nice calmness in his game. He moves extremely well for a guy of his size. You can see in his demeanour off the ice that he is calm, cool, and collected… Excited for him."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/10/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-game-2-projected-lines-tv-info/,Sheldon Keefe on Hildeby:,"He had a tremendous season last year. He is a huge guy. He is older than his experience would say in North America. He has had some experience in Europe. Tremendous year last season as a first year in North America, and it seems like he has had a good preseason. I am not too concerned about who will be in goal for them tonight. They got a tremendous performance last night in goal. We have a lot to worry about, including protecting our own goalies and finding a way to get to whoever is in net for them."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/10/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-game-2-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on the keys to shutting down Auston Matthews:,"Keep the puck away from him and make him defend. Minimize your mistakes, and get some love from the crossbars, like last night."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/10/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-game-2-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on the similarities between the two teams after the pre-scout:,"Quite honestly, there are a lot of similarities in how both teams want to play and things we are trying to establish or did establish over there. In terms of structure, it is pretty similar. There are some differences in the defensive and neutral zones, but offensively, it is a lot of what you’d expect."

https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/02/craig-berube-on-the-maple-leafs-wild-6-5-ot-win-in-pittsburgh/,On what the long road trips recently have done for the team:,"I said on the road trip before the break that I thought it was a really important trip at that time to get on the road with the guys only. It is all hockey, right? This is a similar trip. The guys are getting together on the road and being together — yelling together — a little bit more than being at home. We have been a good road team for quite a long time. We just have to keep doing it. We have one game at home, and then we are back on the road."

https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/02/craig-berube-on-the-maple-leafs-wild-6-5-ot-win-in-pittsburgh/,On whether the long goal slump was weighing on Domi:,"I think it bothered him. It would bother any player. But he is a positive guy. He just stays with it, and he comes and plays. He is not a guy who complains about it. He puts it on himself. He keeps things internal. He doesn’t express too much about it. He just keeps playing and working at it. To me, since the break, he has played good hockey for us."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/20/team-canada-vs-team-usa-4-nations-final-projected-lines-discussion-tv-broadcast-info/,Brad Marchand on the challenge presented by this Team USA lineup:,"They are by far the best that I’ve played. No disrespect to the previous teams, but with the way the game has evolved in the last 10 years, some of the players on their team will be some of the best to ever play the game of hockey. They embody a team that competes at the highest level. They have everything. They check well. They play physical. They have incredible talent. The defensemen on their team can all skate. They’re all a good size. Their goaltending is obviously incredible. They don’t have any weaknesses. Their skill level is incredible to watch. When you look at that team, there is nothing wrong with it. It is definitely the best team I’ve ever played against."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/20/team-canada-vs-team-usa-4-nations-final-projected-lines-discussion-tv-broadcast-info/,Marchand on the level of hockey on display in this tournament:,"The guys have gotten so good in the last nine years. The pace has elevated so much. It is incredible to see the speed and the talent of the players these days. Fans really got to witness that, and they really loved it. You’ve seen what it has done in the last week for hockey and the media attention it has gotten. It doesn’t matter when you have the tournament or how you do it. When you get the most competitive guys in the league on the ice together, it will rise to another level. When you are playing for your country, you do whatever it takes to win. It has been an incredible experience."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/20/team-canada-vs-team-usa-4-nations-final-projected-lines-discussion-tv-broadcast-info/,Marchand on how this game compares to Game 7s in the Stanley Cup playoffs:,"Personally, I think it is harder to win these tournaments than it is to win a Stanley Cup. You have 10 or 15 years of opportunity, usually, for a lot of the guys that play on these teams. For the last 10 years, there have been two opportunities, and in the last 12 or 14 — whatever it has been — there have been three. These opportunities are so few and far between. Moving forward, it is going to be a little bit different, but it is hard to understand the importance of these games for Canadians. It is what you dream about it. It is the highest level you can play at for any player in the league — any Canadian, any American, and any player at all. It is a whole other level. It is a game that everybody is going to get up for and be ready for on both teams."

He is such a competitor. That is the biggest thing. You see the way he focuses. He has the drive and confidence to want to be the best. He has the confidence you want in a goalie. I had this conversation with him the other night. When you have a goalie who has the confidence he does, it gives the entire group confidence. You feed off of that. It gives you a sense of calmness. It bleeds throughout the lineup. It has been incredible to have him back there. Some of the saves he has made throughout this tournament will be watched on replays for years and years. Awesome to play with him."

https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/20/team-canada-vs-team-usa-4-nations-final-projected-lines-discussion-tv-broadcast-info/,Drew Doughty on playing for Jon Cooper:,"I love having Coop as a coach. His meetings are very different. He uses different words. He keeps you engaged when he is talking. Off the ice, he is just a great guy. I really enjoy him. He’s a very good coach who is very direct on what he wants us to do. He’s been great to play for. [The pre-game speeches] are where he gets you. I don’t really know how to explain it, but he just keeps you dialed into it the whole time, even if it drags on long. Sometimes, coaches can lose you a little bit, but he doesn’t lose anyone in the room. He has some special way. I don’t know what he is doing, but he is good at it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/20/team-canada-vs-team-usa-4-nations-final-projected-lines-discussion-tv-broadcast-info/,Jon Cooper on playing a momentous game in enemy territory:,"Again, with being in Canada and being able to play in front of our fans in Montreal, it is hard to replicate what happened. It is a hockey experience I will never forget, just being able to walk around and see how happy everyone was about the sport. Can that be replicated here? I am not sure. You hope it will be, but there were probably more Canadians in the stands in Montreal… How do I say this properly? There are probably going to be more Canadians here than there were Americans in Montreal if that makes any sense. In that regard, it will be highly contested on the ice, and there might be chants going on in the stands, but we are here to celebrate the sport. We can sit here and talk politics all we want. This is a different avenue. We are here to celebrate this game. After this game, for all of the little girls and boys out there who are inspired by the players who play this game and how they compete, if they go and become hockey players, that is the real win — not who wins on the ice."

https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/20/team-canada-vs-team-usa-4-nations-final-projected-lines-discussion-tv-broadcast-info/,Mike Sullivan on the call from President Trump:,"It was a distinct honour. Politics aside, when the President of the United States takes the time to speak to our players, it is an incredible honour. It is an indication once again of the impact this tournament has had on people in the United States. People are paying attention. That is a credit to all of the players and their commitment to excellence in how competitive these games have been. It was an incredible honour. I know we have a locker room full of proud Americans. When the President of the United States takes time out of his busy schedule to say a few words to our guys, I know it means a lot to every one of us."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/20/team-canada-vs-team-usa-4-nations-final-projected-lines-discussion-tv-broadcast-info/,Sullivan on whether the politically charged atmosphere around the two nations is bleeding onto the ice:,"I am not sure the political environment has anything to do with what is going on on the ice. There is a certain pride that both Canada and the United States have for representing their country and what this means to all of the players. From watching this tournament with all of the four nations, these players care a lot and have a lot of pride for the jersey they’re pulling over their heads. My feeling from being around this American team is that this group has an awful lot of pride in being American, first and foremost, but also being a part of American hockey, which has developed and grown exponentially over their lifetime. The guys that represent are our very best. They feel a certain responsibility to put their best game on the ice. These players are invested. Because of that, you are seeing the emotionally-charged games that you are seeing out there."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/20/team-canada-vs-team-usa-4-nations-final-projected-lines-discussion-tv-broadcast-info/,Sullivan on the importance of puck management in the tight-checking hockey of these Canada-USA matchups:,"Any time you put that type of talent on the ice, managing the puck is an essential part of winning. If you mismanage the puck or chase offense, the unintended consequence is that you could give easy offense to your opponent. That is something that we have talked about from day one, regardless of who we are playing. We have to manage the puck appropriately in the critical areas of the rink. We don’t want to take the stick out of the players’ hands — these guys are elite players, and we want them to trust their instincts — but we want them to have an understanding of where we are on the rink and the risk-reward relationship. We want to be a team that is hard to play against. I can only speak for our group. I think these guys understand what winning looks like, and managing the puck is an essential part of winning."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/20/team-canada-vs-team-usa-4-nations-final-projected-lines-discussion-tv-broadcast-info/,Sullivan on Jon Cooper’s comment that Canada wasn’t good enough inside the final 20 feet of the offensive zone in last Saturday’s loss to the U.S.:,"I thought we defended extremely hard. It is something we talked about from day one — the importance of making sure we are hard to play against with our commitment away from the puck. Our guys were very committed in that area of the game. The one area we could have done a better job: When we got the lead, we tried to defend it too much instead of staying on our toes and having the ability to control territory. When we are at our best, we are playing a north-south game. We are putting heat on our opponents by controlling territory. When we got that second goal, in the third period, we defended hard and didn’t give up a lot, but I thought we could’ve had the puck more and spent more time in the offensive zone. That starts with a mindset."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/20/team-canada-vs-team-usa-4-nations-final-projected-lines-discussion-tv-broadcast-info/,Sullivan on his team’s ability to force Canada’s top players to dump pucks in last Saturday:,"Structure. If you have structure, I don’t care who the player is. If you have to go through five players at this level of the game, it is difficult. You have to beat layers of defense. I thought we played with pretty good structure through the neutral zone, in particular, which is a really important area of the rink. A lot of times, the neutral zone decides which end of the rink you are going to play in. If you make good decisions with the puck, your ability to play inside the offensive zone increases. If you have structure without the puck, you have the ability to make it hard for your opponent to enter the zone and have the ability to counter-attack. It is an important zone that sets up the game, and I thought we had pretty good structure through that neutral zone. When you are playing players of that calibre — Connor and Nate are elite players with dynamic speed and are not easy to defend one-on-one — it makes it a whole lot harder for them if you defend in numbers."

We know what kind of a player he is. He is a hard player and does a good job of it. He is physical, and we know he is going to be physical. He is not going to shy away from it. We just have to be prepared for it. We don’t want to react. We want to initiate. That is the biggest thing: not reacting and taking retaliatory penalties. You are going to get hit in this league, and things are going to happen. It is about being disciplined."

You are not going to have your best game every night. That is hopefully our worst of the year (vs. Columbus). You have to make sure the next one is detailed and a little more hard in all three zones. You have to come out a lot harder than that."

Player or coach, it doesn’t matter. A team that gets rid of you is a team you always want to win against, especially when it is the first game. We are going to try to get this one for him, for sure."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/24/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-st-louis-blues-game-8-projected-lines-tv-info/,Reaves on the difference in the team under Berube:,"The style of play he is bringing to the team is a little more hard-nosed. I think that is the main thing. I think we play a little harder here now, up and down the lineup. It’s something we need. On the forecheck, he demands physicality, especially from F1. He demands it in all three zones. It is not just a couple of guys he demands it out of — it is up and down the lineup, front and back. I think that is something this team has needed. It is definitely welcome."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/24/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-st-louis-blues-game-8-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the emotions of playing against his old team:,"There are emotions, but once the puck drops, they’re over. We’re just playing. We need a good response tonight with our team, and that is what I am focused on."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/24/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-st-louis-blues-game-8-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the message to the team after an ugly loss to Columbus:,"You can look at it a bunch of different ways. For me, we were just loose in the game. They were ready. We knew they were going to be ready. They have some really good players on that team — young guys who are hungry and are going to skate. We let them skate through us all night. You can’t do that. You have to check, and we didn’t check. That is the bottom line. That is where it ends for me. We didn’t check. If we checked early in the game, I think we would’ve been in good shape, but we didn’t check early in the game and got down 3-0. You’re playing catch up, and we couldn’t get a goal by the goalie. We had opportunities, and we didn’t score. You put yourself in a hole. We have to do a better job of that."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/24/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-st-louis-blues-game-8-projected-lines-tv-info/,Blues head coach Drew Bannister on the loss of Robert Thomas to a fractured ankle:,"Unfortunate news for the team and for Robby. He played a great game up to the point of his injury. It is a great opportunity for our team to build as a team. [As we wait] to get him back, whether it is in four or six weeks, it is important for us to get guys to step up in certain roles. There are a lot of guys in there who are capable of doing different things. It is going to be a team effort, and not just one player. A group of us will need to pull together. You can’t make up for the player, but as a group, we can make up for it. It is going to be about the 20 guys in the lineup pulling together for the team."

https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/05/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-6-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Montgomery on the keys to improvement in Game 6:,Checking mindset is one. Getting to the hard areas better offensively is two.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/05/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-6-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Montgomery on the absence of Auston Matthews:,Tremendous player. Best goal scorer in the league since he came in. Great player. But they played great without him last game.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/05/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-6-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Montgomery on whether David Pastrnak has had a “great game” yet this series:,"I think we have had a couple. People overanalyze the goal scoring. They don’t recognize what he does. He is out there for us in every empty net situation. People underestimate his value as a defensive player and a guy who knows how to win. No one usually scores at the same level in the playoffs as they do in the regular season. You are playing the best of the best. That is why the teams are in it. The teams that end up in the finals’ numbers tend to reflect pretty close to the regular season or slightly below just because there is a bigger sample size. We all get caught up in five games. I can look at any five-game segment for our players, and they’d be far below their potential offensively and defensively."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/05/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-6-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Montgomery on leaning on Brad Marchand’s leadership coming off the Game 5 loss:,I know he is going to be great tonight. I know he is going to be competing hard. That is what we know and the voice he has brought as a captain to our team.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/05/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-6-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Sheldon Keefe on the team’s playoff struggles at home vs. the road:,"As I have been alluding to, when we come in, our plan doesn’t change, and our approach doesn’t change, but our mindset seems to change. In particular, it is about staying with it and staying consistent with it. When I look at the games we have played here, in Game 3, we gave up three shots in the first 15 minutes. In that sense, it is a pretty similar game in terms of defense. We didn’t have much of an offensive push in that game, but we were doing a nice job defensively. It is about maintaining that play and staying with it. When you have a plan coming in, you have to stay with it for a long period of time, which is what we did really well the other night. We weren’t fazed by whatever happened in the game. We played a great period. It was still 1-1. It didn’t make us change. We just stayed with it and stayed with it. We had to kill a penalty, and we got it done. We haven’t done that to the same level on home ice. That has been not just a playoff trend but a regular-season trend for us. It is the same mindset. This is the best road team in Leafs history. We haven’t been able to replicate it on home ice, but we have earned ourselves another opportunity to get that right now."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/05/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-6-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Keefe on the team’s strong play in its two games without Auston Matthews this season:,"It is a bit of the human nature piece. You recognize everybody has to be better. They’re two different types of games — one is regular season against Pittsburgh, and the team played really well but also filled the net. Everything seemed to go in the net that night. It is the opposite type of approach the other night. It is a discipline game. It is a consistency game. It is sticking with it, grinding it out, and finding a way to win a hockey game. It is more about the confidence our team has that we can respond when players are out. In this series alone, we had no Willy in Game 1 or Game 2, but you still have to find a way to win a game on the road. If we don’t get that win, we are not even here talking. That piece is important. We have confidence there. We can trust in the group. If anything, it shows the strength of the group and the importance of the group not looking to others but just doing your part, trusting that the group will find a way to prevail in the end."

I don’t like to see that. I don’t want Mo to get into interactions like that. I need him to focus on the game and helping us win. That is all it is.

It gave us the positivity and momentum that we needed. Anything can happen. We knew it was going to be a long series anyway. It doesn’t matter if we are down 3-1 or not. We just have to keep chipping away."

I have a lot to prove. I am excited to get out there now and prove it in front of the fans. I haven’t had a training camp in about four years or so between injuries and Covid. It’s definitely nice to get up to speed. You realize how important training camps really are. It’s been a really hard [camp] so far, but I think it is going to pay off. I feel amazing.

They can both hang onto pucks in the offensive zone and create a lot of offensive-zone time but also score some goals and create some offensive opportunities. It is a heavy line. They just have to make sure they advance things through the other zones, get it behind people, and go to work. That is what I see in that line with those two guys together."

It makes me feel good. But he was one of the best power-play players at that time. It is cool to see him come in and teach it the way he did it. He was a really savvy player. We had our first meeting on power play today. It was really good stuff in terms of thinking outside of the box and some plays I haven’t seen before. Looking forward to it.

If you look back with the Bruins, he did a lot of good things with the power play. He just has that mindset that skilled power-play guys understand. He has good ideas. He always has some plays and different ideas, but he has good structure on his power play."

https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-st-louis-blues-game-12-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on what the team learned from the game tape of theLeafs‘ 5-1 loss to St. Louis on Oct. 24:,"We do use footage of what we didn’t accomplish in the game. We had 43 shots on the net in that game. Out of those 43 shots, there weren’t a lot of second and third opportunities. We missed some opportunities — open nets and things like that — where the execution was off a little bit. We just weren’t hard enough. We didn’t play a hard enough game, in my opinion, and the goals they scored, we gave them. We were a little loose in some situations."

They really like their teams, whether it is the Cardinals or Blues. They are very passionate about their sports. They are also very friendly people. I got to know a lot of people here and made a lot of great friends. The people are great here."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-st-louis-blues-game-12-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the need to improve team discipline and reduce penalties:,"For me, it is understanding situations. If you are in the offensive zone, there is no reason to take a penalty there. You are 200 feet from your net. When you take a penalty, it should be desperation around your net saving a goal with some sort of desperate play. At times, we are just careless with our sticks. We have to be more disciplined with it. That is the biggest thing. You are going to take penalties in a game for whatever reason — I get — but when you are using the stick, the guy takes the puck in the offensive zone, and you want to give him a tug, that is a penalty where you have to be disciplined. It is a mindset. Move your feet. Get your stick on the ice."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-st-louis-blues-game-12-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Jake McCabe on whether there is extra motivation knowing it’s Berube’s return to St. Louis:,"Absolutely. We let Chief down a little bit in that first game in Toronto. He is not one to make a big deal out of it, but we want to put a good effort forth tonight, stay out of penalty trouble, and keep this momentum going from the last couple of games."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-st-louis-blues-game-12-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,McCabe on the recent loss to the Blues and how it feeds the pre-scout ahead of tonight’s rematch:,"We played them recently, and we didn’t love our game against them. We are looking to have a good start and go from there. Any time you can go through your pre-scout video and you are not only watching how you played against them but how your systems looked, it always helps in that aspect. Looking forward to getting a good start out of our group tonight. We need to be aggressive and get on the forecheck."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-st-louis-blues-game-12-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,McCabe on the early success of his pairing with Chris Tanev:,"We’ve played a lot on the penalty kill together, so there are a lot of similarities in that sense. I think we are similar in how we like to go about our games, use our feet, and use our checking ability when closing in the defensive zone and breaking out cleanly. It has been going well so far. We talk a lot out there. [Tanev] is an ultimate pro and super easy to play with."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-st-louis-blues-game-12-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,"St. Louis head coach Drew Bannister on his team’s recent 2-1 loss to Flyers, extending the Blues’ losing streak to three games:","I thought we did a lot of good things on both sides of the puck, but right now, our mistakes are amplified. We just have to clean up the minimal mistakes we made. If we play that way and clean up mistakes, we will win more hockey games than we lose. I think we played well but I still think we can do more. As a team, when things aren’t going well, you have to be able to change things up – you have to change things on the fly, but you have to re-adjust after games to give yourself the best chance to win. It’s important when guys play well that we give them an opportunity, and if some guys aren’t playing well, then they might move down the lineup at times."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/02/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vegas-golden-knights-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Simon Benoit on what has clicked during the team’s seven-game winning streak:,"Sometimes, it just happens, right? There is no explanation. Something clicked. We won’t find a reason. We are just happy that it did. We are going to try to keep it going by focusing on tonight’s game. That’s it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/02/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vegas-golden-knights-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Benoit on potentially playing with Morgan Rielly:,"My game is pretty simple, right? Let him do whatever he wants out there. I just stay back, eh?"
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/02/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vegas-golden-knights-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Benoit on Sheldon Keefe’s comment that Rielly’s fingerprints are all over the winning streak despite missing five of the games due to suspension:,"Mo is a team player, right? We knew he was not happy missing out on those games. Everybody played a little bit for him and made sure we got those points, especially in a tight race here. For him to be back, it is a good thing. He is a great player and a great teammate to be around. Even though he wasn’t on the ice with us, he was still with us around the team. He is a big impact guy. Sitting next to him and talking to him, he is a great guy. He is really genuine. He is really calm. He knows what he wants. He plays hard. You just learn from what he does on and off the ice."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/02/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vegas-golden-knights-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Sheldon Keefe on the challenge of a rematch vs. the Cup champs coming off of a road trip:,"It is something we have to be aware of. It is something you have to be conscious of. You don’t want to have any letup. The fact that we are playing the same opponent — and an opponent we have a tremendous amount of respect for — should in and of itself be enough for us to not take a step backward. Any fatigue that we might be facing coming back from the road trip, to me, is nothing in comparison to playing in the back-to-back as we did when we went into Vegas. It was our best effort of the season when it came to the work rate, our enthusiasm, and the feel of our team. It was a back-to-back situation in the middle of a long road trip. That level of effort and enthusiasm is going to certainly be required tonight. I would fully expect the game to be entirely different than it was when we were out there. I expect it to be hard, tight, and a grind all the way through. But the effort and enthusiasm that we had is certainly going to be required as the baseline. In fact, we probably need a little bit more than that because we are going to have a better group on the Vegas side."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/02/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vegas-golden-knights-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Bruce Cassidy on the benefits of playing the same team twice in a week:,"For a coach, you have less work to do because you just saw them. Your pre-scout is fresh on your mind. The benefit is that we didn’t play well. Our guys are a proud group and a competitive group. They will want to put their best foot forward."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/02/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vegas-golden-knights-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Cassidy on the blueprint for a better result in the rematch:,"You have to check well and stay out of the box. You need timely saves. They are a good offensive team. They are going to get looks. You have to be opportunistic and score some goals. You can’t expect to go out and play a 2-1 game against a really good offensive team. We are going to have to score a little bit as well. The blueprint is the opposite of how it worked out in Vegas where we were chasing the game from the middle of the first period onward. That part has to be better. I did like our discipline. We didn’t take many penalties. I thought Matthews had some looks, but he wasn’t the driving force. It was the middle of the lineup that did a lot of damage, and the bottom of their lineup was great. Their fourth line had us hemmed in all night."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/02/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vegas-golden-knights-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Keefe on the challenge of running six left-handed defensemen:,"I don’t like it, but just as I have said a number of times this year, whether it is injuries or illness, the players just play. You make the best of the situation. That is really it. Those are not always ideal circumstances, but there are positives to playing on your offside, too. If you are playing a better team game overall, you can enhance those positives. If you are not playing as good of a team game, you can enhance the negatives and the difficulties that come with it. We will just focus on our overall team game. We have a number of guys who are at least comfortable on the right side, or if not comfortable, at least they have experience with it and can manage it and press on."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/02/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vegas-golden-knights-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Cassidy on whether the Leafs running six left-handed D might be something his team can take advantage of:,"I think so. On D-to-Ds in the neutral zone, if you take a good angle, you can limit where they go with the puck or force a quicker play. When the puck is coming around the boards in the offensive zone, you recognize that you can get on top of them a little quicker, so you have to take it backhand to forehand. I don’t know how well they pivot on their offside — stuff like that you don’t know until you play against them a few times — but in general, there are a few opportunities to do that. You also have to be mindful of the one-timer on the D-to-D. You might have to cheat out a little higher on it if you want to be in a position to block."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/22/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-columbus-blue-jackets-game-49-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Steven Lorentz on whether the Oct. 22 loss to the Blue Jackets is in the back of the team’s mind heading into the rematch:,"For sure. You look back at some video, and there are definitely mistakes that happened. You address those. As the season goes on, you play a lot of different teams, but we have to get their number again. We have to get back to playing our way. We can’t take any team lightly when they come into our building. We expect their best coming into Toronto. We have to focus on ourselves tonight and bring it from the first shift, kind of like the Tampa game where you start with shift one and roll from there. You can’t think big picture or think about later on in the game. If we play a shift at a time and stick to our systems, we will be okay."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/22/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-columbus-blue-jackets-game-49-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the decision to start Dennis Hildeby:,"Woll has had a lot of work — a lot of emotional games, I would say, like against Montreal and Tampa. Those are big games and emotional games. A lot of work. With the schedule, it was time for Hildeby to get in there."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/22/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-columbus-blue-jackets-game-49-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the challenge presented by the Blue Jackets:,They have some good players over there. They really do. Size and strength. They can score. Werenski is having a great year on the backend. Very good player. They come at you pretty good. Their power play has been clicking. Young team that plays with a lot of energy and some really good skill.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/22/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-columbus-blue-jackets-game-49-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on whether the players are keeping the 6-2 loss to Columbus in the back of their minds:,"They remember it for sure. They don’t forget about that, but it is a different time. We just have to focus on what we need to do to be successful in the game. That is what we talked about this morning: our mindset going into the game and our motivation level. We have to check tonight. That is going to be important because of their talent and speed. We have to play a tight-checking game. We will get our opportunities. That has to be the approach."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/22/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-columbus-blue-jackets-game-49-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Columbus head coach Dean Evason on coaching against Berube:,"I have coached against Chief for a long time. I played against him. Fortunately, I didn’t have anything to do with him on the ice. I have tremendous respect for what he has done as a coach at every level he’s been."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/22/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-columbus-blue-jackets-game-49-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Evason on his team scoring just one goal in the last two games:,"You get the defensive zone cleaned up, and then your scoring (dries up). You get your scoring up, and your neutral zone (goes). We are constantly tweaking, as every team and every coaching staff does. We want us to continue to play the right way and give ourselves a chance to stay in hockey games. We’ve talked about that a lot, at home and on the road: giving ourselves a chance to stay in games, not feeding into teams, and not letting the game get away from us by cheating it. We don’t want to talk too much about scoring goals. We have the recipe of defense-first that will allow us to translate to offensive opportunities and hopefully goals."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/22/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-columbus-blue-jackets-game-49-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Evason on the impressive 2024-25 season by Zach Werenski:,"You see the minutes, you see the stats, and you watch some of the goals, and those are all fantastic factors in helping us win hockey games. But what he has done as a leader, as a calm presence, and as a mature person within the locker room has really helped us. He does a lot of things that people don’t see from the outside but we clearly value from the inside. With the adversity we’ve talked about with Johnny Gaudreau, and we don’t have Boone Jenner or Erik Gudbranson — two of the leaders on our hockey club as captain and assistant coach — it has allowed him to step up and be a leader within our hockey club. He is a quiet guy. He doesn’t get up on the soapbox and give a lot of speeches, but he has spoken to the group a few times. That leadership has given him the confidence to play with the ability he has physically."

I was definitely overwhelmed coming back last time. I think I had 90-100 people here or something. It gets to you. To be honest, it is going to be an experience you remember for a while. Just enjoy it."

They don’t slow down. Paying to play tonight. I am extremely grateful to have the people show up. They showed up at the draft. I had a ton of people at my first game here. Those were two big firsts for me. Tonght, it will be the first time I’ll be like, “Alright. I’ve done this before. I can just play the game and have fun.”"
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/22/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-columbus-blue-jackets-game-49-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Del Bel Belluz on his best memories from growing up as a Leafs fan:,"Coming to Leafs games with my parents and my sister. We went to a lot of games together, and sometimes just with me and my dad. It is where I fell in love with the game here at the ACC at the time. Such a cool rink and atmosphere. It is going to be awesome to be out there tonight. … There were a couple of playoff games I went to as a Leafs fan that were pretty cool. There was one where Auston Matthews scored an overtime winner against Chicago. He came down on a 2-on-1 and kind of went backhand bar. It was in and out so quickly. That was in the first couple of years of his career."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/22/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-columbus-blue-jackets-game-49-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Del Bel Belluz on his appreciation for Auston Matthews’ game:,He is one of my favourite players. His shot is unbelievable. He has a really underrated two-way game. He strips guys off pucks. He plays with a little bit of grease. He is a special player. Excited to get out there and face off against him tonight.

I don’t know the exact number, but there is going to be a good crowd. I can’t thank them enough for wanting to support me and coming out here. It is not like any of those people asked for tickets. They found their one way to get their own tickets to support me. I can’t thank them enough."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-game-46-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Jake McCabe on the challenge presented by the Devils:,"Dangerous off the rush, especially. They have a lot of guys who can move out there. Hughes and Bratt stand out as far as threats off the rush and their ability to move laterally. We have to make sure we have good gaps on them, and we are defending as five-man units, taking away time and space and ensuring we are tracking and getting above them to limit their odd-man rushes and chances off the rush. It is a good team over there. We snuck a win out against them last time, so I am sure they will come out hungry."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-game-46-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,McCabe on the biggest thing he learned from Sheldon Keefe:,"I have had a lot of coaches in this league over my time. Keefer really opened up my mind for the offensive side of the puck, gaining middle ice, and how that can break teams down. With different systems things and just preparing for a game, I thought he prepared well."

He had lots of successful teams here. Obviously, we didn’t get it done in the playoffs, but I don’t think there is any bad blood there, from my understanding."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/16/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-jersey-devils-game-46-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,McCabe on the mentality of the team after John Tavares’ injury:,"Next-man-up is the catchphrase for most teams in this situation, and we are no different. It gives guys who are slotted down the lineup more of a chance, whether it is on special teams or taking important faceoffs and playing with different guys. It gives some other guys some bigger opportunities to step in with more ice time. I like the depth of our team. We have shown that it is an asset in the past when we have had guys out. I don’t expect anything different."

The whole league seems to go through it, so you have to nip it in the bud and stick together as a group, as we always do. It is three games, man. Just have to win one, and we are back in the groove here."

Someone is getting a better opportunity. When Auston was out, we played a real strong team game every night, relied on our checking, and did the right things, as well as special teams and things like that. We have to stick with the program. We have to check hard tonight and find a way to score more goals. That is what it boils down to."

He is such a gamer, too. When I spoke with Caber after being let go, one of the things I said to him was, “Every team needs a Jake McCabe.” He is that guy. He is the ultimate team player. He plays the game hard and honestly, but he also works at his game. I really enjoyed having him. He helped us a great deal. Clearly, he is a big part of their team, too."

It feels very familiar. Everything from my drive-in to my walk-in was very familiar in that sense. It will be different tonight to be on the other side of it, but I also don’t want to make it bigger than it is. It really is ultimately a hockey game, and the players will determine the outcome on the ice on both sides. I will look to enjoy it for what it is and move along."

You have to be tight on him, not give him an inch, and defend in layers. A good challenge for us."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/23/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Hyman on the summer when he left Toronto:,"It worked out the best it possibly could have worked out. When I was going through the process, I didn’t look at any other team besides Toronto until I knew that door was closed. I didn’t have much of a choice with regard to that door. As soon as that door closed, I quickly looked at Edmonton and said, “Out of all of the teams, this is the place I want to be.” My wife and I got permission, and we went out and visited. Right away, we knew it was the spot. That was the key thing: Do we think we can grow a family there? That was most important. Hockey-wise, it was a dream fit. I knew from the start that it was where I would fit in best and where we would have the best chance to win. Ultimately, that is what you want: to win a Stanley Cup. Having an opportunity to play with Connor, Leon, and Nuge was a dream scenario for me. It has worked out the best it possibly could have."

I don’t think many people would’ve thought I would have the opportunity to do it here, obviously. It would be pretty special."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/23/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Hyman on when he thought this opportunity might be realistic:,"I was four goals away going into Buffalo, and it was probably not realistic. And then I scored two. I have scored two before. Everybody is making a big deal of it, but I don’t think I have won here (in Toronto) yet. That is the focus. You can’t really choose when you score. You go to the areas and you make plays. You try to do your part."

He is a great goal-scorer. He goes about it differently than maybe an Auston Matthews, but he is a great goal-scorer in his own right. It’s been fun to watch."

He is so smart. I don’t think he gets enough credit for how smart he is. He is always in the right area and putting himself in a position to score. It is really impressive to watch.

He is able to possess the puck and not give it away, which allows Connor to make those plays. The biggest thing is how good he is around the net, whether it is a deflection, a backdoor tip, or fighting for space and not getting tied up. He does all of those little things reading the play, and he is also part of a power play that is pretty good and he contributes to. There are a lot of things that he does well that contribute to his goal total. I didn’t know much about Zach coming in [to Edmonton], but I was told what a good, quality person he is and that he is an outstanding teammate who everyone looks up to. My time here has just confirmed everything I have heard about him. He is so positive and upbeat. He works hard in practice. Ultimate team guy. With him scoring so many goals, guys on the bench are always excited when he puts them in. With the chase for 50, guys are encouraging him to hit that and will be happy for him."

He got to the paint more and better than anybody. Now he is playing with a guy who gets the puck to the paint and tilts the ice more than anybody in the history of the game. It is a good fit, and he works to get to the right places. He is getting rewarded for it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/23/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-edmonton-oilers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Knoblauch on encouraging his defensemen to activate offensively since taking over the bench:,"Right from the beginning, we have talked about wanting to make plays. We don’t want to be a safe team that is just dumping and chasing and grinding it out. When you have star power and the players that we do, it is not the game you want to play. As a coach, you have to be aware and acknowledge that mistakes do happen. Sometimes someone gets in a bad position, gets caught up ice, or gets a pass intercepted for a goal or scoring chance. Part of it is encouraging our defensemen to get up in the play. On the best offensive teams, defensemen are involved. They are making it an odd-man rush. I like that. We have a lot of defensemen who can contribute, and they have been doing a pretty good job."

https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/07/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Sheldon Keefe on the adjustments needed from Monday’s loss to Boston:,"As you go through it, it is less about the tactical things. When we have been at our best, there has been a different level of competitiveness and urgency on the puck. That makes us a better team. That is required even more when you play a team like Boston. It is a real hallmark of their group. We have to be able to match and exceed that. It is an additional challenge for us to do it against this team and more of a challenge to do it on a back-to-back. We went into Vegas a couple of weeks ago and it was a back-to-back. You were thinking it would be a real challenge. You are not quite sure what you are going to have as a team. We laid it out there as one of our better efforts. It is going to be a similar type of deal for our team tonight to dig in and find another level."

https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/07/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Brad Marchand on the atmosphere in Boston forLeafsvs. Bruins games:,"Toronto has been probably our biggest rivalry over the last decade. They have been a great team and we have had some really good playoff series. Between them and Tampa, we have competed against them the most and had some of the most exciting games. The fans embrace it and enjoy it. The building will be rocking. It will be exciting. It’s motivation to come out hard tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/07/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Marchand on his team’s six wins in a row over Toronto:,"Just because we have won in the past, it doesn’t mean it is going to have an impact on the game moving forward, but it is a team we get up for. They are a very gifted and talented team. We feel the rivalry every time we go into their building or they come in here. Guys get up for this game, and you can tell they do, too. They are always very intense, emotional games that come down to the wire or OT. Those are the games you want to be a part of — emotional, exciting, and intense."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/07/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Marchand on the difficulty of shutting down Auston Matthews:,"He is going to get opportunities every night. There is no question about that. We are trying to limit those. You are not going to limit them all because he is so gifted at finding open space and the connection he has with his linemates. They make things happen. You are not going to be able to stop them from getting opportunities. Hopefully, you can get a stick on it, block a couple, or the goalie makes a big save when the time comes. It is a matter of time with him. He scores every game, or if he doesn’t score one game, he is getting two the next. He is a very gifted player and one you definitely have to keep an eye on. It is about trying to limit how many opportunities he gets. You are not going to shut him down. Just have to play tight on him."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-islanders-game-39-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on playing the Islanders for a third time in the span of a couple of weeks:,"We have played them twice already, so we have a good idea of what they want to do and what they are [about]. It is going to be a hard game. That is a good team over there. They have played us well this year. Both games were pretty difficult. We have to make sure we are checking hard tonight, doing a good job against their skilled guys, and managing the game properly."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-islanders-game-39-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Jake McCabe on the areas for improvement in the team’s recent stretch of .500 hockey:,"Throughout the course of the year, it always comes down to getting the two points, but in the grand scheme of things, we haven’t been overly happy with our game in the last 10 games or the last few weeks, frankly. It has been inconsistent. We are looking for a good 60-minute effort to continue to build our game and get where we need to get to. A lot of it comes down to how we defend. It sets up the rest of our game: how we check. A lot of times, our forecheck and checking through the neutral zone turns pucks over and creates offense for us. It’s about getting back to that and limiting the odd-man rushes that have been creeping into our game, too. It starts with the defensive side of the puck. That’s doesn’t mean just defensive zone; it’s play without the puck."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-islanders-game-39-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on Matthew Knies’ performance in Tuesday’s 3-1 win over the Isles:,"Way more engaged in the game. He was shooting the puck, hounding the puck, and getting on it. He was more reckless, as we talked about. He was a much-improved player. He is a guy who can really drive the play for us with his ability to get on pucks, skate, be physical, hang onto pucks down low in the offensive zone, and get to the net. He is a big part of our team."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-islanders-game-39-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Matthew Knies on the strengths of his game on Tuesday:,I think I was just playing more directly and more simply. I was moving my legs more and creating space. I played a better game because of it.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-islanders-game-39-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Patrick Roy on his team’s performance in the loss to Toronto on Tuesday:,"I thought we played a good game. To be a great game, we have to win, but we played a good game. We had a lot of chances. We didn’t give them much. It was a hard-fought game. Both teams played well. We had our chances to score goals, and we didn’t. They scored two — three with the empty netter — and won. It was the kind of road game you need to play, but bear down on your chances and get out with the win. It was 12-10 chances for us. It was a game where there was not much for either side. In the second period, we had a couple of good looks, and their goalie made those saves."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-islanders-game-39-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Roy on his team’s inconsistency offensively and scoring just once in Tuesday’s loss to Toronto:,"Sometimes, it doesn’t have to be pretty. The pretty ones will come with confidence. Right now, it is a matter of finding ways to score goals in different ways. I thought that was the biggest difference between the first time we played (Toronto) and the second time. The good thing, and I’ll knock wood: Our PK was really good. We didn’t give up any scoring chances. We kept them on the outside. With the goalie we have, we should be fine."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/01/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-islanders-game-39-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Roy on his players’ comments that pulling the goalie for the defensive-zone faceoff late in the third period on Tuesday was another example of his desire to do whatever it takes to help his team win:,"That’s all I am trying to do. I am here to help the players. That is what I said in the meeting. In the past, coaches dictated a lot of things. Now, coaches are here to support the players, help the players, bring ideas, and try to help the guys generate more offense and play better defensively. We do everything we can do as a coaching staff to help this team. There is one thing I promise everyone here: We will work really hard to make this team win and make our fans proud of our team."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-4-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Brad Marchand on the Bruins’ points of emphasis in Game 3:,"Everyone was very determined to lock down the neutral zone, play above their speed, and play behind them. We didn’t cheat any area of the game. We didn’t cheat the details. Everyone was determined to do their job, step up, and be big for the team—block shots, take a hit to make a play, or whatever it took. We executed at a high level. It is a recipe for success, and we have to replicate it in [Game 4]. It is not going to be easy. They are going to elevate. They have players over there who have the ability to take over a game in the series. We just have to make sure we are determined. We have to win our one-on-one battles. When you line up against a guy, you need to have the determination that you are going to beat them and win that matchup. Usually, in these games, a minor mistake costs the game. The team that makes the fewest mistakes at this time of year usually wins the game."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-4-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Jim Montgomery on the flow of the series so far:,"It is the hard part of a series, especially when you have two evenly matched teams: Who can win two in a row and really take control of the series? It hasn’t happened yet. It is a tough task. I liked where our team was at. I felt more people were business-like — as Marchand was — at the morning skate before Game 3."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-4-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Montgomery on whether the series is playing out according to expectations:,"I don’t go into any playoff series expecting anything. They are unpredictable, and that is why they are so much fun. That is why fans love it. That is why players love playing it, and coaches love coaching it. Tonight could be a 6-5 game. You don’t know. You just have to be prepared to play and stay present."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-4-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Sheldon Keefe on the expectation for the fourth line with Nick Robertson on the LW:,"Just keep doing the things that they’ve been doing. Nick has to find his place on that line. We need Kampf and Reavo to keep doing what they have been doing and be themselves. I need Nick to be himself. There is a reason why [Robertson] is remaining in the lineup. We think he can provide us with offense. Offense is hard to come by, and goals are hard to come by. I think he has done a good job in this series. It is not just that he has proven he can score over his hockey-playing life or in the regular season. He has done a good job in the series. He has found ways to create chances in low minutes. We think he can make a difference that way. It was not an easy decision whatsoever. Dewar has done a tremendous job in his own place with what he have asked of him. Tough decision. We are preparing for Willy to play at this point, and with that being the case, you have to make a lineup change while weighing all of the different things. This is a look we want to go with. You want that line to keep doing what they’ve been doing. It’s really important that Nick finds his way on it. Maybe the line can be even better."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-4-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Nick Robertson the key to fitting in on the fourth line:,"Sticking to their strengths. They play a north, physical game. I think I can add my touch in the offensive zone and kind of stick to their process without the puck — being a little more physical and hard on pucks. I look forward to playing with them."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/27/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-4-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Jake McCabe on the physicality of the series:,"We are doing a lot of the initiating. The guys are playing hard and physical lines one through four and all of the defensemen. We’re all playing hard. As we talked about with discipline, it’s about staying on that line and being in control of our emotions while continuing to push and drive that physicality."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/15/team-canada-vs-team-usa-4-nations-face-off-projected-lines-discussion-tv-broadcast-info/,Mitch Marner on the reaction of hisLeafsteammates to his OT winner vs. Sweden:,"A couple of them reached out saying some positive things. It was nice. A lot of them are on vacation enjoying their time, but a lot of them are trying to catch as much as they can. You appreciate that."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/15/team-canada-vs-team-usa-4-nations-face-off-projected-lines-discussion-tv-broadcast-info/,Marner on the atmosphere around the game and the possibility of the Canadian fans booing the American anthem:,You appreciate the support for us. I am not going to speak to what they do for the other anthems. It’s what they want to do.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/15/team-canada-vs-team-usa-4-nations-face-off-projected-lines-discussion-tv-broadcast-info/,Auston Matthews on the anticipation for a Team Canada vs. Team USA rivalry game:,You can expect it is going to be a pretty great atmosphere and a lot of fun. It is going to be intense. This is a game everyone is really looking forward to on both sides. We know the building is going to be rocking. Going to be a lot of fun… I expect it to be fast and physical. Both teams have so much high-end skill. There is going to be such an emphasis on trying to limit those high-end guys and keeping them in front of you as much as possible.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/15/team-canada-vs-team-usa-4-nations-face-off-projected-lines-discussion-tv-broadcast-info/,Matthews on whether this is the biggest game he’s played in as a professional hockey player:,"I think I have played in some pretty big games — Game 7s and things like that — but with the history, and this is my first opportunity playing in a Canada vs. USA game at this level, it is definitely up there."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/15/team-canada-vs-team-usa-4-nations-face-off-projected-lines-discussion-tv-broadcast-info/,Matthews on the keys to keeping Mitch Marner quiet:,He is a special player. We just have to take away his time and space. A lot of guys on the Canadian team play with a lot of skill and pace. They like to attack and challenge you one-on-one. You’re just trying to keep them in front of you as much as possible.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/15/team-canada-vs-team-usa-4-nations-face-off-projected-lines-discussion-tv-broadcast-info/,Matthews on the possibility of the Canadian fans booing the anthem:,"I am not really going to get into it too much. I obviously don’t love to see that, but it is what it is. It is out of our control. That is all I am going to say about it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/15/team-canada-vs-team-usa-4-nations-face-off-projected-lines-discussion-tv-broadcast-info/,Matthews on his line with Jack Hughes and Jake Guentzel:,We were moving the puck really well and created some great opportunities (against Finland). We were good in our own zone. The chemistry seems to be gelling pretty well there. We just want to continue to get better tonight and take positive steps forward.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/15/team-canada-vs-team-usa-4-nations-face-off-projected-lines-discussion-tv-broadcast-info/,Jon Cooper on the much-anticipated rivalry game vs. the USA:,"I think it is going to be really, really, really good hockey players against really, really, really good hockey players. As you’ve gone through the history of international hockey, a couple of decades ago, USA-Canada probably wasn’t a big deal. Because of the progression of USA Hockey in the last 20 years, it has really propelled them to the forefront of hockey. Much like Sweden and Finland will be earlier in the day, this is pretty much the same thing, except it is on our turf. It is going to be a ton of fun. The day, for so many reasons, with both of those games going on, will be, to quote Bob Johnson, “A great day for hockey.”"
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/15/team-canada-vs-team-usa-4-nations-face-off-projected-lines-discussion-tv-broadcast-info/,Cooper on Sam Bennett entering the lineup on the fourth line with Brad Marchand:,"It will be interesting if Sam and Matthew (Tkachuk) meet in a corner at some point. I hope nobody is sitting here thinking that Sam was just brought here to play against the USA. He was brought here to play for Team Canada and play his game. That kid has been nothing but an awesome soldier in this whole group this whole time. As he said to me, “Coop, if you asked me to play for this team, and you told me I wasn’t going to play any of the games, I still would’ve come.” You are cheering for someone with that type of attitude, but our goal was to make sure everybody got into at least one game. It is just unfortunate that [Sanheim] is getting in because of an injury. Sam has proven, as he has shown over the last couple of playoffs, that he can rise to the occasion in these big moments, especially when the physicality and the game is at its brightest. He has done a heck of a job. We expect them from him tomorrow."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-53-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Calgary head coach Ryan Huska on the challenge presented by theLeafs:,"With the skill set of their top players, you have to know where they are on the ice. They are playing a little different style than we have seen in the past. You have to be ready for more of a trench-type game where you have to make sure you are prepared to compete along the walls."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-53-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Huska on the invasion ofLeafsfans into the Flames’ home rink:,"It is like a road game at times, unfortunately, but it is the way it is. A lot of our players have seen it before. It is not going to change the way we play the game. We are going to come out and try to initiate, dictate, and set the tone tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-53-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Nazem Kadri on a Canadian rivalry game vs. his former team:,"It is always fun. I am sure there will be a few blue jerseys hanging around. It’s all the more exciting for us to try to limit their chances and keep them off the board. It is always fun playing against former teams and friends. First and foremost, we need the points in the standings. You have to set it aside and go out and play."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-53-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,"Huska on former-Flame, now-Leaf Chris Tanev:","He was a great teammate. There are a lot of things to appreciate about the way he played the game. With him being in Toronto now, people probably recognize how good of a player he is. We saw that firsthand for four years. His consistency was off the charts. There weren’t too many games where you were like, “Tanny, you’re not there.” The one thing that always stands out: No matter what the situation, I have never seen a guy play through things like he has played through at times. It is pretty impressive what he will do for his teammates."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-53-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Kadri on former teammate Chris Tanev:,"A true competitor and a warrior. He will do anything for his team. That is something we really appreciated from him. He’ll play hurt. Just about anything you need from Chris, he’ll provide. That is what makes him such a great leader. He is a great professional. He shows up to work every single day, no matter how he is feeling. That is why he has gotten the contract and the respect that he has gotten."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-53-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the challenge presented by the Flames:,"They are a hard-working team and have been for years. They are going to compete and work. They’ve added two new players to their roster. They look like they are playing pretty well. I saw Frost and Farabee in Philly for a while, and they’re good players. We are going to be challenged, I’ll tell you that. It is not going to be easy, and we don’t expect it (will be). We are going to have to earn everything. Their goaltending has been lights out."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-53-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the opportunity for Max Domi on the top line if Mitch Marner can’t play:,"Going back to last year, Max played a handful of games or more with Auston. They had some pretty good chemistry going. He is a passer. We need a passer on that line with Matthews and Knies. He is a guy who can make plays. With Max, it is all about his skating. He needs to move. He needs to attack and have that mindset."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-53-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the balance between eliminating risk from the team’s game and still generating rush offense:,"When the rushes are there, take them. We are not trying to take the game or the sticks out of the guys’ hands. When there is a chance to attack off the rush, by all means, go do it. We just don’t want to put ourselves in tough situations by forcing plays through the middle of the ice when they are not there. That is the nuts and bolts of it. We have had rush opportunities this year — plenty of them. It is not like we don’t try to do anything off the rush. When they are there, they are there. When they are not, make good decisions with the puck."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-53-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Chris Tanev on the growing importance of each game as the season heads toward the final third:,"Huge game tonight for both teams. The league is so tight now. Win one, lose one, and the standings change quite dramatically. There are three games until the break, and they are all extremely important."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-53-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Tanev on compensating for the absence of Mitch Marner:,"He has been our best player all year. He does everything, right? It is not just going to be one guy who is going to be able to do that. We are going to need a group of guys to step up and pick up the slack. He has been our best player all year, and he plays a full 200-foot game."

We haven’t played with each other this year, but it is a great opportunity. We’ll be ready to go."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-53-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,John Tavares on the keys to surviving the potential absence of Marner:,"I don’t think it is on one individual. In all of the areas that he plays in — which is pretty much every area of the game — everyone is going to have to step up and execute at a high level. We have a solid team throughout with great depth. It is an opportunity for a lot of us to take advantage of it and thrive on it. Obviously, you are never replacing a Mitch Marner and what he can bring. If he is not there tonight, it is just on the group to come together collectively, as we have at many points this season with different guys in and out of the lineup — a lot of guys who are really important to our team. It is a similar mindset."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/04/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-calgary-flames-game-53-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Tavares on the past chemistry between Domi and Matthews:,"Max is a tremendous passer and sees the ice extremely well. There are a lot of similarities between him and Mitch that way with their ability to distribute, find the open man, and make plays. Auston feeds off of that really well. He has such amazing awareness of where to go and where to be, finding the open ice with the timing of all of that. If they are together tonight, they have shown some good success in the past, which is a really strong benefit for us."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/14/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-philadelphia-flyers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Sheldon Keefe on Auston Matthews’ goal scoring cooling off recently:,"A lot of our guys seemed like they were worn down a little bit with the demands of the schedule, especially once we got past that Buffalo game. The turnaround in Boston was as miserable of a travel night as we have had all season with some of the challenges that we had. The Gardiner was shut down that night getting to the airport, the weather was bad in Boston, there was customs, and it was 3 a.m. in the morning (when we got in). And we had to prepare for the Boston Bruins. It was a tough stretch. I think that bled into Montreal as well. Specific to Auston, he had at least two maybe three chances where he is basically in alone on the goalie in Boston. Those didn’t fall for him. Things have fallen a lot for him this season, and they will again, but the historic pace that was on is historic for a reason. It is difficult to maintain. I think this break will be good for him."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/14/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-philadelphia-flyers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Keefe on the Knies – Kampf – McMann trio:,"Kampf, for me, has shown in his time here that he can elevate. He can take on more responsibility. We have gone with Domi in the middle of most of the season here. With Kampf as the fourth center, he has played a little bit of a different type of role than what he has played in the past. We have known and felt that he can take on more and elevate. Right now, Mitch’s absence forces me to rethink some things and look at different things. That is part of why you saw the line as they were the other night. I like the line. They are three guys who have good size and speed. They are good in possession of the puck. They are on top of people very quickly. They didn’t spend very much time in our zone. It was our most successful line (in Montreal). Even though the Domi and Tavares line got us two very important goals, I thought our best line offensively was the line of Kampf, McMann, and Knies. That was great to see. You are not necessarily expecting that out of them. You expect hard defensive play and to be able to help us win some territory, but they also got to the net."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/14/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-philadelphia-flyers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-2/,Keefe on Calle Jarnkrok joining the top line and top power-play unit in Marner’s absence:,"In terms of Jarnkrok’s presence in that group, it is the right shot. Whether it is the breakout, the faceoff, or in the zone even, he plays the same role that Mitch plays on the second unit. He is very familiar in that sense. It gives us another right-handed option on the power play there, which is important. We tried it with the additional lefty the last time. We didn’t like it as much. Jarnkrok is a guy who, if you give him a plan and tell him what you need from him, he is going to do what he can to make it happen. Really, it is about keeping things moving for the other guys who are normally in that group."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/18/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-dallas-stars-game-32-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Pete DeBoer on the differences in the pre-scout of theLeafsunder Craig Berube:,"They definitely look different. You can see his fingerprints on the team and what they are trying to do. At the same time, they still have that game-breaking ability when you look at the roster, especially with Matthews back in now. You can say they are playing more direct. They are more of an O-zone possession team. They are getting to the slot more. All of the analytics point to a harder, heavier team in those areas of the ice — defensively, too. But you are not going to take away the game-breaking ability of the guys they have there who are special. If you give those guys room or free offense, they are going to take advantage of it. Dangerous team."

He really solidified our defensive group. He played big, hard, heavy minutes for us against all of the league’s top players. If you look at our playoff path last year, we had Eichel and Vegas in the first round. We had MacKinnon and Colorado in the second round. We had McDavid and Edmonton in the third round. He was playing against all of those guys every night. He was a big part of what we did here last year."

We all grew up on Hockey Night in Canada. We all know the importance of hockey in Canada if you grow up there. Playing theLeafsis always special if you are a Canadian kid.

This is going back years that they have had this core. They play a good brand of hockey. They don’t give up a lot defensively, and they play a fast game. Their special teams are good. It is a hard team and a good team."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/18/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-dallas-stars-game-32-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on Pete DeBoer-coached teams:,"He is a great coach and has done really well everywhere he has gone. His teams all play the same way. I remember New Jersey, when he got here, started their swarm defense. His neutral zone was different back then — it was a 1-1-3 more than it is now; it is a 1-2-2 now. But that swarm defense with both a D and a forward in there outnumbering you right away has been a signature for a long time with him. His teams all play fast. They move the puck quickly and play north hockey."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/18/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-dallas-stars-game-32-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on his message to the Nylander-Matthews-Marner line:,"I thought they were pretty good together and created some opportunities. For me, with those guys all being together, it’s, “Don’t be too fancy.” You still have to play the right way, be direct, shoot pucks, and get to the net. I talked to the guys. You can’t all be on the outside wanting the puck trying to create space for yourself. You have to be direct still, and you have to have guys at the net still. If someone has the puck, the other two guys have to read off of each other and be at the net. If they have the puck and are skating with the puck doing all this stuff, but no one is at the net and no shots are getting there, it is pretty much useless."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/03/toronto-maple-leafs-notebook-depth-scoring-offense-defense-special-teams/,"Knies is shooting 23.7 percent this year, and while he might ride it out as a hot year overall, it’s not sustainable year-to-year. That said, his shot has really improved, and he knows how to cause havoc in front of the net, which is usually a recipe to be a really good goal scorer.","“I’m sure [Marner and Tavares are] getting a lot more attention for it, but I think they’re on the same page as me. I don’t think we’re worried about it; we all want to stay, and we’re all going to try to figure out how we can manage to all stay here.” –  Matthew Knies, on him, Marner, and Tavares dealing with their expiring contracts"
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/03/toronto-maple-leafs-notebook-depth-scoring-offense-defense-special-teams/,"This isn’t exactly the one of the three that you want to hear say, “We want to stay, and we’re going to work together to figure out how to,” as the Leafs own Knies’ rights as a pending RFA compared to the other two, but it’s a noteworthy comment nonetheless. First and foremost, these three players — and the overall core — need to prove this year that it’s worth keeping them together beyond this season. If they do, the Leafs have the money to run it back.","“I want to be here, so I’m fine. Yeah, I don’t think about that stuff…But desperate times call for desperate measures. Fight or flight. You want to survive? You want to play in the game? You gotta elevate… When it’s desperate, I’ll be physical. I’m wanting to get into the game, be impactful… Last year, the most I played was 20 games (in a row), then I got scratched, shifting in and out. I hate that. So, I made a decision that I want to play every single game. Like I said, back to the desperation thing, I want to be in the lineup every game. I want to be an impactful player. And so far, it’s been working.” –  Nick Robertson on wanting to stay in Toronto and working to find ways to contribute by playing more physical and desperate"
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/03/03/toronto-maple-leafs-notebook-depth-scoring-offense-defense-special-teams/,"Now, it appears Robertson is starting to learn from those experiences and coming out better for it on the other side. There’s no denying his shot, but he can’t score every game and needs to find a way to impact games when he’s not scoring. Robertson has a really good motor—he can annoy opponents with it—and the third line seems to be buying into their scoring role. It has been a positive development as the season has progressed.","“You have to determine fact from fiction. What players are actually available? If you look around, there are still a lot of teams in the race. If I had to categorize it, it is busy, and you are talking to lots of guys, but in comparison to years past, it is a little bit slower. There are a lot more teams that maybe haven’t declared yet. There are lots of conversations going on.” –  Brad Treliving on the trade market"

https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/22/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-2-preview-projected-lineups-tv-broadcast-info/,Jim Montgomery on his starting goalie for Game 2:,I don’t like keeping you guys in the dark. Do any of you play Wordle? The starting goalie tonight has two vowels in his first and last name.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/22/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-2-preview-projected-lineups-tv-broadcast-info/,Montgomery on why he keeps his goalie decision tight to his chest:,"I don’t know why we would divulge information. If you are preparing for a game, there are parts of the goaltender that are a part of your pre-scout. That is an advantage for us, right? We don’t know who is starting. I don’t tell my wife. I am not telling [the media]."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/22/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-2-preview-projected-lineups-tv-broadcast-info/,Montgomery on what he is hoping to repeat about the team’s Game 1 performance:,I liked our physicality. That has to be repeated. I liked how we got over top of people. We didn’t give up too much off the rush. That is really important against such an electric offensive team.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/22/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-2-preview-projected-lineups-tv-broadcast-info/,Sheldon Keefe on the expectation for his team in Game 2:,"I expect our team to come out and play hard, play well, and play — in a lot of ways — like we did the other night. Just make a few fewer mistakes and finish a few of our chances. We don’t have to change much more than that. Quite honestly, we liked a lot of things about our game. We just have to get back to it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/22/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-2-preview-projected-lineups-tv-broadcast-info/,Keefe on shifting Tyler Bertuzzi onto PP1:,Bert is good around the net. It gives you a second guy similar to John in the sense that he can hound the puck and be good around the net. That is really it.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/22/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-2-preview-projected-lineups-tv-broadcast-info/,Keefe on the message to Max Domi after his slashing penalty in Game 1:,It is playoff hockey. I don’t even have to talk to Max about these things. He has been through it a lot. It is all part of the intensity. I don’t need Max to change anything about who he is and how he plays. He is an important guy for us. I love the intensity he brought the other night. He got caught on a penalty. Their guy is probably going to give the same slash 10 times over the rest of the series. We’ll see if he gets called on it. I love Max’s intensity.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/04/22/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-boston-bruins-game-2-preview-projected-lineups-tv-broadcast-info/,"Keefe on the group of six defensemen he’s started the series with, with TJ Brodie on the outside looking in:","We looked at how the season has gone, how the group has come together, how the pairs fit, the opponent, and the type of matchups and intensity you expect early in the series. Those are the guys we are going with."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/19/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-philadelphia-flyers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Flyers captain Sean Couturier on sitting as a healthy scratch:,"I’ve been putting the work in for a while. I’ve been struggling, but I’ve been working on my game, and it’s frustrating the way I’ve been treated around here lately. But it is what it is."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/19/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-philadelphia-flyers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Couturier on whether he’s received direction from John Tortorella on what he needs to do to play more and stay in the lineup:,"Not really. I have gotten the same answer as [the media]. “I just need to see more.” I am still looking to find out what that is. I am trying every game. It is not like I am just sitting around and doing nothing. I have felt that in the last couple of games, in the limited ice time or opportunities I am getting, I am doing alright. I guess we are going with the best lineup available tonight to get a win, so it is what it is."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/19/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-philadelphia-flyers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,John Tortorella on where Couturier’s game stands:,I think there are a number of players — him being one — that need to be better.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/19/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-philadelphia-flyers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Tortorella on what a player such as Couturier needs to show him in limited ice time to earn more minutes:,"Him, Cam… A number of guys need to play better. It is the old chicken-or-the-egg. “Give me ice time, and I’ll show you.” I have given people plenty of ice time. The people that I have slotted and given more minutes deserve it. There is no special answer I can give you. You have to play better. I don’t care if it is 10 minutes. I don’t care if it is 17-18 minutes. I don’t care if it is seven minutes. You have to give me something to hang my hat on to keep on earning more ice time. I am coaching 20 guys, not just one, two, or three. Those are the decisions I have to make."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/19/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-philadelphia-flyers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Tortorella on how he handles players who disagree with their ice time allotment:,"You talk about it. That is easy. Those are conversations. A lot of times, you don’t agree, but you still have to make the call in terms of ice time and I go about my decision that way. Certainly, when you are dealing with players who want more, you want the conversation. You want to hear what they have to say. They need to listen to us, too. When people want more ice time in the team sport, they forget that there are other people who are playing around them, too, who might be playing better. Those are the decisions I have to make. For me, I don’t care about name, stature, veteran… especially at this time of year, I don’t care who you are. I am going to put the guys that I think give us the best chance to win that particular game. We have talked about this. We certainly have discussions. They have a right to disagree. They have a right to have a discussion with me. I think that is how you develop relationships within a team over a long year."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/19/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-philadelphia-flyers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Sheldon Keefe on the type of response he is expecting from the Flyers after the news of Couturier’s scratch:,They are a team that is playing to qualify for the playoffs. Things are getting tight around you. For that reason — and they are a proud team coming off of a loss to Boston and a loss to us — they are going to play well and play hard. I fully expect a response. I talked to our team today. Something like scratching their captain gets the team’s attention. We certainly expect their best tonight.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/19/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-philadelphia-flyers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Joel Edmundson on what the team did well last week vs. the Flyers:,We just limited their odd-man rushes. They are good off the rush. We just played as a five-man unit all over the ice and didn’t give them many chances.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/03/19/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-philadelphia-flyers-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info-3/,Bobby McMann on the type of response he is expecting from Philly:,"A hard one, I am sure, especially when you have beat a team in their own building. They are going to come back, and they are going to come back hard. I am sure the first five minutes will be fast, and hopefully, we can grab the game from there and take it to them."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/24/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-utah-hockey-club-game-21-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on what he learned from the pre-scout of Utah’s 6-1 win over Pittsburgh last night:,"The power play was good. They got three. They’re fast, and they have a lot of skill. They make a lot of plays — a lot of west-west plays — and get up the ice really well. Their D are involved. We have to check well tonight. We have to stay out of the penalty box. Our PK is going to be important. Overall, we need to take time and space away from this team right out of the offensive zone. Be hard on them breaking plays up. That will be very important tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/24/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-utah-hockey-club-game-21-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the decision to start Joseph Woll over Anthony Stolarz tonight:,[Woll] had a really good game against Vegas. We are just thinking ahead here. Stolly has played a lot. We have some time here. He is working in practice and doing a lot of good things. That’s really it. We just talk about things and make decisions on what we think is best for the goalies and the team. I talked earlier about how both goalies are going to see more net than they have in the past. It is important that we manage it to the best of our abilities. Woll is coming off a real solid game against a real good team. We wanted to go back with him.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/24/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-utah-hockey-club-game-21-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on what improvements he is looking for from his team offensively after a week of practice:,"Attacking more than we are. There are times when we tend to just control the play a little bit too much on the outside. We could attack more with more shots to the net, get pucks low to high, and do more on-and-off shooting while getting people to the net with numbers around there. Resets to the back of the net, making quick plays out of there, doing things a little bit quicker, moving it quicker, supporting it quicker, and getting more pucks to the net than we are."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/24/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-utah-hockey-club-game-21-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on why Fraser Minten is so trustworthy despite his lack of experience:,"It goes back to a great draft pick, finding a player who is so responsible at a young age. You guys aren’t on the bench, but just hearing him talk on the bench and how he sees the game, he says all the right things. You don’t see young guys do that very often. He is already doing it at a very young age with very little experience. It is great to see. It’s refreshing. It really is."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/24/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-utah-hockey-club-game-21-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Minten on the keys to success for his line with Nikita Grebenkin and Alex Nylander:,"We just have to be simple with pucks and forecheck, using our speed to get pucks back on the forecheck. From there, let the skill make things happen. Those guys are really good when they get it back, so we have to make sure we are forechecking hard to retrieve pucks, and we’ll go from there."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/24/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-utah-hockey-club-game-21-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Minten on the keys to success in the net-front role on the top power-play unit:,"Try not to overcomplicate it too much. Get the goalie’s eyes, get in sight lines, try to get pucks back, get some tips, get some screens, and cause a little chaos. You can draw a defender with you. If you’re going backdoor, you give them a little more space. Be ready for anything coming to you. They are great players, so just try to read off of them, and hopefully, it goes well."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/24/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-utah-hockey-club-game-21-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Minten on his experience level in front of the net on the power play:,"In junior, I was mostly a flank guy with the puck more, but last year, I kind of got into it more at the end of the year, and I have been playing that role with theMarliesevery game so far this year."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/11/24/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-utah-hockey-club-game-21-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Minten on Morgan Rielly’s guidance at the NHL level:,"He has been amazing. We have a lot in common, being from the same place. He took me under his wing a little bit and has been super nice. It makes it easy when you are coming in at 18 or 19 and there is a guy who comes to talk to you and is a really nice, supportive guy and friend. He has been awesome."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/21/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-game-5-projected-lines-tv-info/,Jon Cooper on the challenge presented by the Leafs under Craig Berube:,"It’s the same cast of characters. They have a good team and are hunting north of 100 points. I know Sheldon (Keefe) and Craig (Berube) — two different styles, but they both win. They have some pushback in their game. I’d expect nothing less."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/21/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-game-5-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the challenge presented by the Lightning:,"This team knows how to win, for one. They have been a very good team for a long time. Their top line is as good as it gets in the league. Very dangerous. The power play is dangerous, too, and there is a great goaltender in net."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/21/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-game-5-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the difficulty of shutting Nikita Kucherov down:,"It is hard. He is elite. It is about trying to take away his options as much as we can and pressuring him. We have to be hard on their skill tonight. That is probably the best way to approach it. In saying that, he is an elite player. He will make plays."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/21/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-game-5-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the challenge of going from facing Igor Shesterkin on Saturday night to Andrei Vasilevskiy tonight:,"Well, they’re both very good. We had plenty of opportunities last game. We missed the net at crucial times. It could’ve made a difference. We can do a better job of creating second and third opportunities around the net with more scrums and get some dirty goals on these guys. That is how you have to approach it."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/21/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-game-5-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on why now was the right time to re-insert Max Pacioretty into the lineup:,"I don’t know if it is a time thing. We have been playing pretty well. We didn’t win last game, so we are just making a lineup change. We have back-to-back games here. I have an opportunity to get fresh guys in there and keep guys fresh for the next game."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/21/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-game-5-projected-lines-tv-info/,Chris Tanev on the painful shot block on Saturday night:,"It didn’t feel great. Sometimes, they get you in the spot where you get a dead leg, and you can’t move. That is sort of what that one did there. I have been hit there plenty, but sometimes you get one in that spot, and it doesn’t feel great."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/10/21/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-tampa-bay-lightning-game-5-projected-lines-tv-info/,Tanev on the challenge of matching up against Kucherov:,Hell of a player. He plays the game at his own pace. He’ll slow it down. He’ll speed it up. We can’t let him dictate and control the game. We have to try to take as much time and space away from him as we can.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-rangers-game-59-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Ryan Reaves on his anticipation for his return to the lineup:,It’s been a month. We’re playing against an old team in a fun arena that is always buzzing. It’s going to be fun.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-rangers-game-59-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Reaves on his memories from fighting Matt Rempe last season:,"Just how tall he was. You hear about how tall somebody is, and then you get up in front of him. He looks a little taller than I imagined. But it’s nothing I’ve never fought before."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-rangers-game-59-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Auston Matthews on his energy levels coming off of 4 Nations:,"I feel fine. It was good to get three wins in three games. I’m getting looks. There have been a couple of posts. It is a little frustrating at times, but we are playing well. We could’ve been better in some areas, but coming off a break that long and winning three games — including a big comeback win the other night — is huge. We want to keep the momentum going."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-rangers-game-59-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Matthews on whether this is the most frustrating run of goal-scoring luck of his career:,"I have definitely had some similar ones, but it is fine. We are winning games. I am getting the opportunities. It is all you can ask for. One is going to go in. Everything will settle down."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-rangers-game-59-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Matthews on the loss of Chris Tanev to injury:,"He is a tough customer. In every game, he blocks a shot, and you think, “That can’t possibly feel good. Something has to be broken.” But he just competes. Unfortunately, he is at a point where he can’t play right now, but he is such a big part of this team with the role he plays on the backend and the minutes he eats up against the other team’s top players and top lines. We have dealt with injuries throughout the year. It is an opportunity for other guys to step up and fill the void with more opportunity."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-rangers-game-59-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Matthews on the challenge of solving Igor Shesterkin in the Rangers’ net:,"He is just never out of it. You think you might have him, but he is so athletic. He might not be the biggest guy, but he has great angles. He is extremely athletic and anticipates the play and pucks very well. It is always a challenge. We have kind of gone back and forth throughout the years, but he is definitely one of the top goalies in the game."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-rangers-game-59-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Rangers head coach Peter Laviolette on the challenge presented by theLeafs:,"They’re an offensive team. They have high-end skill and firepower. We are going to have to make sure we are playing defensively, but the teams we have played recently are capable of scoring a lot of goals as well. Buffalo scored a lot of goals recently. The Islanders’ offense has been pretty good lately. It seems like every night you get an opponent with some players you have to be mindful of, and Toronto certainly fits that situation. It’s about making sure we are doing the right things defensively."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/28/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-new-york-rangers-game-59-preview-projected-lines-tv-broadcast-info/,Laviolette on whether the energy levels of his 4 Nations participants have been lower than the rest of the team:,"They left a big stage with big games. To me, coming back is an emotional thing. It is not that it is not important here, but everybody watched those games. Everyone watched the first one, the second one, and all of the games. Certainly, the US-Canadian game drew a lot of attention, and with that came a lot of emotion. It’s just like inside of an overtime of a playoff game. I think our guys have come in and played pretty well. We have gotten some wins here. There was a game where we weren’t on point, but we are long past that and are looking for a good game tonight. We do try to be mindful of fatigue as well and try to control it as best we can. It was an optional skate this morning, and most likely, everyone who was on the ice yesterday isn’t going out with regard to those [4 Nations] players."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-chicago-blackhawks-game-24-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Blackhawks head coach Luke Richardson on the differences in theMaple Leafs‘ play under Craig Berube:,"I have seen Toronto play a few times. They are definitely playing hard and very structured. That is what he is trying to implement there. They have the talent. They don’t need to take chances. When they get their opportunities, they are going to score on the power play or on their odd-man rushes. They don’t have to open it up wide open. That is the way they played in the past a little bit. It only goes so far. Teams start to check you tight. You don’t get those opportunities, and you give up more on the defensive side. We have to be ready for a hard-work game against a team that has high-end skill."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-chicago-blackhawks-game-24-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Richardson on his team’s 2-0 record versus theLeafslast season:,We have to be confident. It was in the past — it was last year — but a lot of the same guys are here and there. We have to start playing the right way and realize we won those two games by doing that the whole game and frustrating the other team. That is going to be the recipe for success tonight.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-chicago-blackhawks-game-24-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Richardson on Tyler Bertuzzi joining the Blackhawks’ top line with Taylor Hall and Connor Bedard tonight:,"There is always that little bit of extra energy when you’re playing against [an old team]. I think Tyler has been playing really well lately. He is doing a great job on the power play and is around the net always. That is going to be good for Taylor and Connor tonight to get moving in the offensive zone, knowing they have the net-front presence at all times. Getting them out there early and establishing some early good shifts for our team would be a real plus for our team."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-chicago-blackhawks-game-24-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Richardson on the areas for improvement for his team’s offense at 5v5:,"It’s easy to check when you’re still. Toronto does a good job in the offensive zone if you don’t kill the play early. They start what we call the “circus offense” — they start switching and moving all over the place. It is hard to defend. We do it well at times, and we have to do it more often than not tonight. If we can do it more to them than them to us, we are going to have a chance at a good win on the road."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-chicago-blackhawks-game-24-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Chris Tanev on the loss of Jake Mccabe for tonight’s game and pairing up with Oliver Ekman-Larsson in McCabe’s absence:,"Big loss. Really big part of our team on and off the ice. We all hope he is doing well and is back as soon as possible. (OEL and I) need to play similar roles, work hard for each other, have good sticks, play good defense, and break pucks out. [OEL] is a very smart player with a very good stick who moves the puck incredibly well. We will be able to read off of each other and make sure we are talking throughout the game to see if we need to make any adjustments to each other. He is a world-class player. It should go well. We will see what happens."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-chicago-blackhawks-game-24-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Tanev on the shutdown challenge Connor Bedard presents:,"Incredibly skilled. Incredible shot… [Matthews and Bedard] both like to pull it and change the lane quite a bit. It is hard to pick up for goalies. There is a lot of deception in it, for sure. I have the opportunity to work out with [Bedard] a bunch in the summer. He comes and skates with us. I know how good of a player he is and how skilled he is. He is a world-class talent, and they are playing well of late. We have to be ready to go tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-chicago-blackhawks-game-24-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Philippe Myers on jumping into the lineup after appearing in just one game (Oct. 26 vs. BOS) so far this season:,"This obviously means a lot to me. I have been patient. I’ve been trying to be a good teammate hyping up the boys, who have been playing really well. It has been fun to watch, but I am excited to get in here. It is not easy (staying patient), but I have been around and experienced it a little bit over the years. I think I have a good mindset for it this year. I am grateful to be here and to be around the guys. I am super fired up to play tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-chicago-blackhawks-game-24-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Myers on pairing up with Morgan Rielly:,He is one of the best defensemen in the league and has a lot of skill. I am going to try to give him the puck and play defense.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-chicago-blackhawks-game-24-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the OEL-Tanev pair:,"With us losing McCabe, I kind of put two guys together who we can use as a shutdown pair. That is what we are thinking. Ekman-Larsson has a great stick. He skates well. He’s big and plays physical. That is what we are thinking with the pair."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2024/12/02/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-chicago-blackhawks-game-24-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the expectations for Myers in his first NHL game since Oct. 26:,"He hasn’t played for a while — since the game in Boston — but he has practiced well, and he works extremely hard. Keep it simple. He is a big guy who can move well, be physical, and defend well. He is playing with Morgan Rielly, and Morgan can move the puck. Just play your game. His game is simple. You don’t have to complicate it. He has a good shot. Let’s use it tonight. When we get opportunities in the offensive zone, he should be ripping pucks."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vancouver-canucks-game-55-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Rick Tocchet on aLeafsvs. Canucks matchup on HNIC:,"There is a lot of excitement. Any time you play theLeafson a Saturday night, it is big. They are rolling. They have some special players over there. We have found our game a little bit. Grinding out a game against San Jose is good for us. Over an 82-game schedule, you are going to play all sorts of different games. This is a game where we are going to really need everyone playing well tonight. This is one of those games where you can’t have passengers."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vancouver-canucks-game-55-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Tocchet on takeaways from the Canucks’ 3-0 win over theLeafsin Toronto on January 11:,"Every game is different. You can look at some video, but I don’t think we can draw too much. We had a good game, but obviously, Chief didn’t like their game. It seems like they’ve sorted it out pretty well. This is a whole different game for us tonight."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vancouver-canucks-game-55-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Tocchet on whether it is more challenging to match up against theLeafswhen Mitch Marner and Auston Matthews are on separate lines:,We are used to it with McDavid and Draisaitl. We play Edmonton quite a bit when they are together and when they are not together. I have to be sharp behind the bench. There are certain matchups you want. Some people say that it’s easier when they’re together. I don’t know if I agree with that theory. Marner has had an outstanding year. Matthews is one of the best. Nylander seems like he gets a breakaway a game. We have to be careful with that.
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vancouver-canucks-game-55-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Tocchet on how the team has coped with the absence of Quinn Hughes (2-0-1):,"It has been a committee back there. The trade has helped us. The young Pettersson has really given us the juice. Marcus Pettersson has given us some leadership and calmness back there. Myers has been playing well in the last month. Hronek is starting to find his game. If you look at our D, guys are starting to peak a little bit. We need to find some goal-scoring, but the one good thing when we haven’t been scoring goals: You have to keep the puck out of the net, and I think we have done a half-decent job in the last two-to-four weeks — and even since Christmas, in terms of not allowing a lot of shots against."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vancouver-canucks-game-55-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Tocchet on Elias Pettersson’s struggles offensively:,"We spent some time in my offense yesterday. I showed him some power-play video of San Jose. I didn’t have to say anything. He just looked at me and said, “Man, I have to move my feet.” I am glad he is saying it. I don’t have to. We have to get this guy going, and he has to get himself going. That comes with the territory — dealing with pressure. If you want to be a guy who goes against the best, you have to act like the best, and that means moving your feet and applying yourself. We have talked about that. I think he is trying to do that. He is really trying to do that. … I think you learn from the best. When Matthews gets it, you never see him straight-legged. He has his hips down. He is already anticipating. He has great hands, and it is off his stick within half a second. You can learn from that. But it (requires) reps."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vancouver-canucks-game-55-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Craig Berube on the final game before the break:,"The break doesn’t start today. It starts tomorrow. It is a good opportunity to pick up two points in the standings. It is tight. We all know that. We have to be ready to go. We have to skate, be physical early, and get into the game. That will be important. There is a tendency to maybe try to get through the game a little bit, but we have to be competitive. That is the biggest thing: Let’s be competitive, let’s skate, and get yourself involved in the game."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vancouver-canucks-game-55-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on the challenge presented by the Canucks:,"They play good defense more than anything. They check well. They’re a detailed team. Their power play is good right now — 25% or something in the last few games. It is clicking pretty well. The special teams will be important tonight. We have to keep our PP going, and our PK is going to have to be good. We are going to have to play a smart game against these guys. They are not going to give you a lot. You have to take what they give you, and you have to manage the game properly."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vancouver-canucks-game-55-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on what he is looking for from the Nylander-Tavares-Marner line in its second game together:,"Execution, more than anything. For me, there were some times when they had good situations set up, but they didn’t execute it. The puck execution in the game — the whole game — was not great from us by any means (in Seattle). If they execute, the line can be very dangerous, for sure."
https://mapleleafshotstove.com/2025/02/08/toronto-maple-leafs-vs-vancouver-canucks-game-55-preview-projected-lines-tv-info/,Berube on whether there is a lesson to be taken from the 3-0 loss to Vancouver earlier this season:,"That was a while ago, but we do take stuff from there and look at it a little bit. It was a low-event game, for sure. There was not a lot going on in that game. We definitely have to create more than we did. We didn’t give up much, but from an offensive standpoint, in terms of [accomplishing] things with the puck, we weren’t good enough."
