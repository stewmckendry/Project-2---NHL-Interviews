Question,Answer
Brad Marchand on the challenge presented by this Team USA lineup:,"They are by far the best that I’ve played. No disrespect to the previous teams, but with the way the game has evolved in the last 10 years, some of the players on their team will be some of the best to ever play the game of hockey."
Marchand on the level of hockey on display in this tournament:,They embody a team that competes at the highest level. They have everything. They check well. They play physical. They have incredible talent. The defensemen on their team can all skate. They’re all a good size. Their goaltending is obviously incredible.
Marchand on how this game compares to Game 7s in the Stanley Cup playoffs:,"They don’t have any weaknesses. Their skill level is incredible to watch. When you look at that team, there is nothing wrong with it. It is definitely the best team I’ve ever played against."
Marchand on the team’s confidence in Jordan Binnington between the pipes:,The guys have gotten so good in the last nine years. The pace has elevated so much. It is incredible to see the speed and the talent of the players these days.
Mitch Marneron the news that President Trump called the American team this morning:,"Fans really got to witness that, and they really loved it. You’ve seen what it has done in the last week for hockey and the media attention it has gotten."
Drew Doughty on playing for Jon Cooper:,"It doesn’t matter when you have the tournament or how you do it. When you get the most competitive guys in the league on the ice together, it will rise to another level. When you are playing for your country, you do whatever it takes to win."
Jon Cooper on playing a momentous game in enemy territory:,It has been an incredible experience.
Noah Hanifin on Team USA’s five-minute call with President Trump:,"Personally, I think it is harder to win these tournaments than it is to win a Stanley Cup. You have 10 or 15 years of opportunity, usually, for a lot of the guys that play on these teams. For the last 10 years, there have been two opportunities, and in the last 12 or 14 — whatever it has been — there have been three."
Mike Sullivan on the call from President Trump:,"These opportunities are so few and far between. Moving forward, it is going to be a little bit different, but it is hard to understand the importance of these games for Canadians. It is what you dream about it. It is the highest level you can play at for any player in the league — any Canadian, any American, and any player at all. It is a whole other level."
Sullivan on whether the politically charged atmosphere around the two nations is bleeding onto the ice:,It is a game that everybody is going to get up for and be ready for on both teams.
Sullivan on the importance of puck management in the tight-checking hockey of these Canada-USA matchups:,He’s awesome. He is such a competitor. That is the biggest thing. You see the way he focuses. He has the drive and confidence to want to be the best. He has the confidence you want in a goalie.
Sullivan on Jon Cooper’s comment that Canada wasn’t good enough inside the final 20 feet of the offensive zone in last Saturday’s loss to the U.S.:,"I had this conversation with him the other night. When you have a goalie who has the confidence he does, it gives the entire group confidence. You feed off of that. It gives you a sense of calmness. It bleeds throughout the lineup."
Sullivan on his team’s ability to force Canada’s top players to dump pucks in last Saturday:,It has been incredible to have him back there. Some of the saves he has made throughout this tournament will be watched on replays for years and years. Awesome to play with him.

Defensemen#5 Devon Toews — #8 Cale Makar#48 Thomas Harley — #55 Colton Parayko#6 Travis Sanheim — #89 Drew Doughty,"I love having Coop as a coach. His meetings are very different. He uses different words. He keeps you engaged when he is talking. Off the ice, he is just a great guy. I really enjoy him. He’s a very good coach who is very direct on what he wants us to do. He’s been great to play for."
GoaltendersStarter: #50 Jordan Binnington#33 Adin Hill,"[The pre-game speeches] are where he gets you. I don’t really know how to explain it, but he just keeps you dialed into it the whole time, even if it drags on long. Sometimes, coaches can lose you a little bit, but he doesn’t lose anyone in the room. He has some special way. I don’t know what he is doing, but he is good at it."
"Out:Shea TheodoreExtras: Travis Konecny, Thomas Harley, Sam Montembault","Again, with being in Canada and being able to play in front of our fans in Montreal, it is hard to replicate what happened. It is a hockey experience I will never forget, just being able to walk around and see how happy everyone was about the sport."

I am not sure. You hope it will be, but there were probably more Canadians in the stands in Montreal… How do I say this properly? There are probably going to be more Canadians here than there were Americans in Montreal if that makes any sense."
Defensemen#74 Jaccob Slavin — #14 Brock Faber#15 Noah Hanifin — #23 Adam Fox#8 Zach Werenski — #85 Jake Sanderson,"In that regard, it will be highly contested on the ice, and there might be chants going on in the stands, but we are here to celebrate the sport. We can sit here and talk politics all we want. This is a different avenue. We are here to celebrate this game."
GoaltendersStarter: #37 Connor Hellebuyck#30 Jake Oettinger,"After this game, for all of the little girls and boys out there who are inspired by the players who play this game and how they compete, if they go and become hockey players, that is the real win — not who wins on the ice."
