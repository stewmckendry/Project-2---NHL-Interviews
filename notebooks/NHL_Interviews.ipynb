We have to be competitive… They have good special teams — both the PK and the power play — with some guys who can put the puck in the net. They can make plays, starting with their guy, Bedard. They make plays in the offensive zone. They do a lot of good things with the puck making plays. There are a lot of low plays around the net. We have to check well tonight.'},\n",

They elevate their game. Everybody needs to elevate their game tonight not just because Auston is out of the lineup but because we are playing the Bruins. It is going to be a good, hard game.

      "  Answer: We feel good. We had a good practice on Friday. It is not the way we wanted to play in front of the hometown against St. Louis, Chief’s old team. It was not a great game in Columbus, either, but you’re going to have those games. It is a good chance to go out and put a good foot forward against a division rival. It is two teams who don’t like each other. We are going to have to make sure we get up for this one.\n",

It gives them more depth up front. We have to make sure our matchups are pretty tight tonight as best as we can on the road. We have seen a lot of Matthews.

He puts it on himself. He keeps things internal. He doesn’t express too much about it. He just keeps playing and working at it. To me, since the break, he has played good hockey for us.\n",

You have your systems you fall back on and rely on, and you definitely need that structure, but at the end of the day, hockey is a game of mistakes. As long as you are making those mistakes when doing things hard — Brind’Amour preached that, and Berube preaches it, too. It is all about putting your foot to the gas. Mistakes are going to happen, but it is about playing through that.\n",

He cares a lot about the Penguins and our success. He plays an inspired game. He is the heartbeat of this team. I have said it on so many occasions. He is doing everything in his power to help us get to the playoffs. He is our go-to guy on both sides of the puck. He has a complete game. He has a mature game. He has an impact on both sides of the puck. The biggest thing for me: Yeah, he has a 40-goal season and it is remarkable what he is doing offensively, but what flies under the radar is his commitment to playing the game the right way and his commitment to playing defense. It is an important aspect of winning, and he gets it. He leads by example in that regard.\n",

There were not a lot of people in the hockey world who picked the Washington Capitals to be sitting where they are. If you look at it individually, John Carlson is still playing at an elite level. You can make strong arguments that he is playing as good as he has in the last 10 years when you look under the hood and at the numbers. There is the season Dylan Strome is having, and [Wilson] and Logan Thompson. Rasmus Sandin has taken a huge step this year. I feel like our group is very self-motivated. They want to be the best and they want to win. Playing in Toronto is the biggest hockey market in the world, and we have a lot of guys from that area. Playing in front of friends and family is always a little added (juice). But I just feel like they are already highly, highly motivated.\n",

      "  Answer: For 30 minutes, we didn’t play very well. Toronto got after us pretty good. We turned a lot of pucks over, both in our end of the rink and also getting through the neutral zone. They do a really good job with their 1-2-2. They clog up space. We are going to have to be a lot better from the start. I liked how we got out against Minnesota (last game). It is the same thing here. In these afternoon games, you have to make sure you are ready. [TheLeafs] are good in this building. We have to be sharp.\n",

      "  Answer: For me, it is understanding situations. If you are in the offensive zone, there is no reason to take a penalty there. You are 200 feet from your net. When you take a penalty, it should be desperation around your net saving a goal with some sort of desperate play. At times, we are just careless with our sticks. We have to be more disciplined with it. That is the biggest thing. You are going to take penalties in a game for whatever reason — I get — but when you are using the stick, the guy takes the puck in the offensive zone, and you want to give him a tug, that is a penalty where you have to be disciplined. It is a mindset. Move your feet. Get your stick on the ice.\n",

I love trying to pick his brain about hockey and why he is so good. I don’t think he even knows why he is so good. He has these little things that he works on that no one else works on — little skating drills that he does before practice that I’ve never seen before. It is cool to be around such good players who play really differently from each other. It shows that there is not one way to play.

      "  Answer: They just seemed to complement each other well. Lyubushkin himself — at that time — brought a lot to our team in terms of physicality and competitiveness, making it hard to enter our zone and hard to be around our net. It was something that we really needed at that time. You still need it. We have improved in that area with our team mindset as well as some of our personnel — McCabe and Benoit — and Lyubushkin will add to that. He seemed to complement Morgan well and bring out the best in him. Part of it is what Lyubushkin brings and part of it is how it impacts the rest of the group and enhances everybody else, especially when you couple that with Liljegren coming back. Now you get Rielly a partner he has played well with and it’s a good place to start with Lyubushkin coming in with some familiarity. We get Brodie on the left side, too.

At the same time, they still have that game-breaking ability when you look at the roster, especially with Matthews back in now. You can say they are playing more direct. They are more of an O-zone possession team. They are getting to the slot more. All of the analytics point to a harder, heavier team in those areas of the ice — defensively, too. But you are not going to take away the game-breaking ability of the guys they have there who are special. If you give those guys room or free offense, they are going to take advantage of it.

It is the opposite type of approach the other night. It is a discipline game. It is a consistency game. It is sticking with it, grinding it out, and finding a way to win a hockey game. It is more about the confidence our team has that we can respond when players are out. In this series alone, we had no Willy in Game 1 or Game 2, but you still have to find a way to win a game on the road. If we don’t get that win, we are not even here talking. That piece is important.

[Tanev] does a great job of positioning. He is the most willing player in the league to eat shots from everywhere. We talk well, and I think we have been pretty good with the puck as well. When you are good with the puck, you have to defend less. It has been going well so far. I am excited to get back out there with him tonight.\n",

To be able to do that and be as well-rouned as he is even more impressive. He is not just a trigger guy or is always put in offensive situations. He plays in all areas of the game. He carries play. He wins so many puck battles. His takeaways are exceptional. I don’t think he gets enough credit for how smart he is and the positions he puts himself in, especially with how hard teams defend him and how he consistently finds open space with the timing of all of those sorts of things.

It is no surprise or secret that we have been trying to play a little bit differently than they were last year — a little bit more of a north-south style. Sometimes, it takes a little bit of grit to get to the inside with extra effort and battles in front of the net to get a second or third chance or beat your defenseman to the net off the wall. It sounds simple, and we are trying to play a bit more of a simple game, but it comes with a bit of an attitude that you are going to win your check. Ultimately, that can help you score goals. It has come in waves. There have been times when we have felt very good about our game, and there have been times when it’s not so much. That is the same for any team in any season. You want to peak at the right time. It hasn’t been perfect, and we have had a bit of adversity with injuries, but the good thing is that we know what we need to do to be successful.

The biggest thing is how good he is around the net, whether it is a deflection, a backdoor tip, or fighting for space and not getting tied up. He does all of those little things reading the play, and he is also part of a power play that is pretty good and he contributes to. There are a lot of things that he does well that contribute to his goal total. I didn’t know much about Zach coming in [to Edmonton], but I was told what a good, quality person he is and that he is an outstanding teammate who everyone looks up to. My time here has just confirmed everything I have heard about him. He is so positive and upbeat. He works hard in practice. Ultimate team guy.

We have to get back to that where we are tight all over and are not giving up much. I find we are giving a little bit too much up right now and are a little loose at times.

      "  Answer: They just seemed to complement each other well. Lyubushkin himself — at that time — brought a lot to our team in terms of physicality and competitiveness, making it hard to enter our zone and hard to be around our net. It was something that we really needed at that time. You still need it. We have improved in that area with our team mindset as well as some of our personnel — McCabe and Benoit — and Lyubushkin will add to that. He seemed to complement Morgan well and bring out the best in him. Part of it is what Lyubushkin brings and part of it is how it impacts the rest of the group and enhances everybody else, especially when you couple that with Liljegren coming back. Now you get Rielly a partner he has played well with and it’s a good place to start with Lyubushkin coming in with some familiarity. We get Brodie on the left side, too.

He was not going to be out there 4-on-6 — it is not a situation he plays in, and to me, that would be forcing it. At 6-on-5, he was the next guy up.

You can make strong arguments that he is playing as good as he has in the last 10 years when you look under the hood and at the numbers. There is the season Dylan Strome is having, and [Wilson] and Logan Thompson. Rasmus Sandin has taken a huge step this year. I feel like our group is very self-motivated.

I need Nick to be himself. There is a reason why [Robertson] is remaining in the lineup. We think he can provide us with offense. Offense is hard to come by, and goals are hard to come by. I think he has done a good job in this series. It is not just that he has proven he can score over his hockey-playing life or in the regular season. He has done a good job in the series. He has found ways to create chances in low minutes. We think he can make a difference that way. It was not an easy decision whatsoever. Dewar has done a tremendous job in his own place with what he have asked of him. Tough decision. We are preparing for Willy to play at this point, and with that being the case, you have to make a lineup change while weighing all of the different things. This is a look we want to go with.

The last thing is that the spirit of the team has to improve. When something like this happens, the spirit is at a low. We are going to work hard to build it back up. We are going to focus a lot more on what is happening from minute one to minute 60. I know there is a history of being in the playoffs, not being in the playoffs, winning streaks and losing streaks.

To be able to do that and be as well-rouned as he is even more impressive. He is not just a trigger guy or is always put in offensive situations. He plays in all areas of the game. He carries play. He wins so many puck battles. His takeaways are exceptional. I don’t think he gets enough credit for how smart he is and the positions he puts himself in, especially with how hard teams defend him and how he consistently finds open space with the timing of all of those sorts of things.

      "  Question: Red Wings head coach Derek Lalonde on the keys to success against theLeafs:\n",
      "  Answer: Own the middle ice. It has been an interesting team to watch back in that they haven’t been the offensive juggernaut they have been in the past. Obviously, they have high-end guys. We can’t give their top-end guys easy ice and easy looks. That will be the challenge. This is a really good team. I didn’t mind our game in Toronto last time out. We limited some offense from them, but we got checked pretty well, too. It is on us to stay within our game. In the last game, we did not for the last 10 minutes of the second period.\n",

      "  Question: Carbery on the differences in theMaple Leafs‘ game under Craig Berube:\n",
      "  Answer: A couple of things. You are going to have to work your way through the forecheck pressure because you know they are going to put a ton of pucks in behind you. It may seem like an easy accomplishment to just break the forecheck pressure, but when they do it time and time and time again, eventually, they are hoping you crack one or two times. We have to stay consistent with our breakout structure, support it, and find ways to advance out of our zone. The other thing, which is maybe a little bit to do with the moves that they made with adding OEL and Taev: They defend the interior of the rink as well as anybody. Everyone talks about the goalies and how they’re having great years, but a lot of it is them protecting the inside of the rink. It is so hard to get in there with A) people and B) to get pucks delivered in there. They really push you to have to earn your offense against them at five-on-five.\n",

It is the opposite type of approach the other night. It is a discipline game. It is a consistency game. It is sticking with it, grinding it out, and finding a way to win a hockey game. It is more about the confidence our team has that we can respond when players are out.

He cares a lot about the Penguins and our success. He plays an inspired game. He is the heartbeat of this team. I have said it on so many occasions.

He has an impact on both sides of the puck. The biggest thing for me: Yeah, he has a 40-goal season and it is remarkable what he is doing offensively, but what flies under the radar is his commitment to playing the game the right way and his commitment to playing defense. It is an important aspect of winning, and he gets it. He leads by example in that regard.\n",

We want to be an aggressive team that plays very fast and plays winning hockey. With today’s analytics, you can see where your team is. I really like what we’ve done with expected goals against. With expected goals for, we are 20th for the year, and 15th since December 1st. If you are in the top half of the league offensively and you are right near the top defensively, it is a pretty good recipe for winning. We have preached playing the game the right way and not cheating the game. We want to take away time and space and create time and space. We have done a good job of forechecking and creating chances. We are in the top 10 there. But we are not finishing, quite frankly. I think we are 32nd in finishing, and some of our guys have been snakebitten. Sometimes that happens.

The fact that we are playing the same opponent — and an opponent we have a tremendous amount of respect for — should in and of itself be enough for us to not take a step backward. Any fatigue that we might be facing coming back from the road trip, to me, is nothing in comparison to playing in the back-to-back as we did when we went into Vegas. It was our best effort of the season when it came to the work rate, our enthusiasm, and the feel of our team. It was a back-to-back situation in the middle of a long road trip. That level of effort and enthusiasm is going to certainly be required tonight. I would fully expect the game to be entirely different than it was when we were out there. I expect it to be hard, tight, and a grind all the way through. But the effort and enthusiasm that we had is certainly going to be required as the baseline.

You worry about a little bit of a mental letdown, but it goes back to what we have talked about since day one with our identity and being a team that can win long term and win in the playoffs. When you love winning, and you are ultra-competitive, it doesn’t really matter if you are playing hockey or playing checkers. You are going to play the right way.\n",

That is what it is about. We have given up 15 goals against this team in two games. It is one of the most skilled teams in this league. If you don’t defend and don’t take care of the puck — and you make it easy on them — they make you look bad. It is not just us. It is teams across the league. When they are at their best and the game goes their way, that is what they do. We have to respect it with how we play. We have to adapt and be aware of the style of game.

      "  Question: St. Louis on the development of Alex Newhook in his first season as a Hab:\n",
      "  Answer: Like every young player, you try to explain to them to play the game, not just his game. He has a lot of speed. Most of his life growing up with that speed, he probably had the puck a lot. You try to make him understand that at this level, the game is played without the puck. I feel he has taken huge strides on both sides of the puck to really be engaged — not just start getting engaged when the puck touches his stick. He finds some great pockets. He has good speed. I think he is learning to decelerate, too, to keep those pockets… It is learning to use [the speed] to get into position and not to let it take you out of position. We are on blades. We glide. There is a lot of momentum. To control the speed is really important on both sides of the puck so that he keeps us in balance on the ice. I have been really happy with his progression on both sides of the puck.\n",

      "  Question: Jon Cooper on the questions from the outside about Team Canada’s goaltending:\n",
      "  Answer: We get asked questions about forwards, defense, and goaltending. Everybody plays their positions. Ultimately, it is a team sport. That is it. When a goal is scored, for the most part, it is usually not the goalie’s fault, but he always gets the rap because he is the last one who sees it. He is the one who has to dig it out of the net when it is in there. Usually, there has been a progression of a blown backcheck, a missed hit, or some system breakdown all the way to the end. The goaltender, for 65 shot attempts and 30 shots at him a game, has to make the save. I don’t get into [that]. I look at the guys and say, “Well, that guy has won a Cup, and that guy has won a Cup.” I look over somewhere else and say, “He hasn’t won a Cup, and he hasn’t won a Cup.” You put guys in big-time situations, and it is about how they perform. On our team, we feel that we have a whole bunch of guys who have performed in pressure situations all the way through our lineup, but this is a team sport, man. You win and lose as a team. I feel that we are sold in every single position. I sleep well at night, thinking that I have this team to stand behind the bench with. I am excited about it.\n",

I am going to bet that both teams are excited about the game tonight. I thought the best game we have played in the last couple of weeks was the Boston game. It was a hell of a game.

      "  Answer: He is always ready when called on. He has done it his whole career. I have the most confidence in him. Going back to last season, it doesn’t matter who was between the pipes. You knew he was going to bring it. I think our group has already seen the flashes of it in the preseason with some of the big saves he has made. Those are a little more flashy; he is usually just calm and collected in the net. Whether it is Woller or [Hildeby] in net, we have great depth in the system. They are all big guys who take up a lot of net. It is pretty intimidating to be a shooter against those guys. It will be a good test for [Stolarz], but I know he is up for it.\n",

      "  Question: Jon Cooper on the questions from the outside about Team Canada’s goaltending:\n",
      "  Answer: We get asked questions about forwards, defense, and goaltending. Everybody plays their positions. Ultimately, it is a team sport. That is it. When a goal is scored, for the most part, it is usually not the goalie’s fault, but he always gets the rap because he is the last one who sees it. He is the one who has to dig it out of the net when it is in there. Usually, there has been a progression of a blown backcheck, a missed hit, or some system breakdown all the way to the end. The goaltender, for 65 shot attempts and 30 shots at him a game, has to make the save. I don’t get into [that]. I look at the guys and say, “Well, that guy has won a Cup, and that guy has won a Cup.” I look over somewhere else and say, “He hasn’t won a Cup, and he hasn’t won a Cup.” You put guys in big-time situations, and it is about how they perform. On our team, we feel that we have a whole bunch of guys who have performed in pressure situations all the way through our lineup, but this is a team sport, man. You win and lose as a team. I feel that we are sold in every single position. I sleep well at night, thinking that I have this team to stand behind the bench with. I am excited about it.\n",

When you have star power and the players that we do, it is not the game you want to play. As a coach, you have to be aware and acknowledge that mistakes do happen. Sometimes someone gets in a bad position, gets caught up ice, or gets a pass intercepted for a goal or scoring chance. Part of it is encouraging our defensemen to get up in the play. On the best offensive teams, defensemen are involved. They are making it an odd-man rush. I like that. We have a lot of defensemen who can contribute, and they have been doing a pretty good job.\n",

Most of his life growing up with that speed, he probably had the puck a lot. You try to make him understand that at this level, the game is played without the puck. I feel he has taken huge strides on both sides of the puck to really be engaged — not just start getting engaged when the puck touches his stick. He finds some great pockets. He has good speed. I think he is learning to decelerate, too, to keep those pockets… It is learning to use [the speed] to get into position and not to let it take you out of position. We are on blades. We glide. There is a lot of momentum. To control the speed is really important on both sides of the puck so that he keeps us in balance on the ice. I have been really happy with his progression on both sides of the puck.\n",

If we play that way and clean up mistakes, we will win more hockey games than we lose. I think we played well but I still think we can do more. As a team, when things aren’t going well, you have to be able to change things up – you have to change things on the fly, but you have to re-adjust after games to give yourself the best chance to win.

      "  Answer: Maybe being a little bit grittier around the net. It is no surprise or secret that we have been trying to play a little bit differently than they were last year — a little bit more of a north-south style. Sometimes, it takes a little bit of grit to get to the inside with extra effort and battles in front of the net to get a second or third chance or beat your defenseman to the net off the wall. It sounds simple, and we are trying to play a bit more of a simple game, but it comes with a bit of an attitude that you are going to win your check. Ultimately, that can help you score goals. It has come in waves. There have been times when we have felt very good about our game, and there have been times when it’s not so much. That is the same for any team in any season. You want to peak at the right time. It hasn’t been perfect, and we have had a bit of adversity with injuries, but the good thing is that we know what we need to do to be successful.

You can make strong arguments that he is playing as good as he has in the last 10 years when you look under the hood and at the numbers. There is the season Dylan Strome is having, and [Wilson] and Logan Thompson. Rasmus Sandin has taken a huge step this year. I feel like our group is very self-motivated.

We are constantly tweaking, as every team and every coaching staff does. We want us to continue to play the right way and give ourselves a chance to stay in hockey games. We’ve talked about that a lot, at home and on the road: giving ourselves a chance to stay in games, not feeding into teams, and not letting the game get away from us by cheating it. We don’t want to talk too much about scoring goals. We have the recipe of defense-first that will allow us to translate to offensive opportunities and hopefully goals.\n",

I’d rather try Rielly-Tanev as a top pairing, considering they already saw time together and meshed much more naturally to me. It would then bump OEL to play with Myers while keeping the Benoit – Timmins pairing together. There is still familiarity with two of those pairings, and I think the combo of Rielly-Tanev gives them the best possible pairing overal. But it’s possible the other two pairings won’t be good enough to allow them to keep Rielly and Tanev together, and Tanev shouldn’t be playing 22+ minutes at this point. Still, I’d like a longer look at this pairing.', 'Bert and I are so close now. It is one of those things where he hates attention. I just wanted to spotlight him a little bit there. He had such a big day. It was his birthday. Most guys didn’t know it was his birthday until closer to the game because he is not that guy. He doesn’t want that kind of attention, which I respect so much. He is super low-key — just a normal, humble dude.
